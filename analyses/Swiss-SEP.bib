  abstract = {The creation and use of composite indices for capturing various complex or multidimensional concepts (eg, deprivation, geographic access, green space, sustainability, corruption, transparency) has become extremely popular. Measures are created at national, regional or small-area level. There is considerable literature on creating measures at the national level, much of it critical, discussing the different implicit (and potentially biassed) decisions taken by researchers or organisations creating the measures.1 Few researchers discuss the different choices available or the steps taken to create small-area measures and the subsequent effect of these decisions on the results.2–5 More often, measures are created with little discussion or justification of the methods, let alone validation or uncertainty. We believe there is scope to review and evaluate the steps and options available when creating composite measures. As an example of the process of developing a small-area measure, we are focusing on deprivation measures in public health research. Small-area deprivation measures have been widely used to understand inequalities in health in the UK since the 1980s6–8 and have since become common in many other countries.9–12 They are appealing as they help summarise complex phenomena into a single numeric representation, are easy to use and allow robust national level analysis with aggregate data. Nevertheless, the seemingly simple composite measures belie many important decisions explicitly (or sometimes implicitly) taken by the researchers. Our aim is to outline the key stages and options available to researchers, and to discuss their potential merits and problems. Historically, small-area deprivation measures have aimed to locate areas (and the people living in these) on a scale of material well-being,6 13 but more recently this has also extended to the physical environment.14 The measures generally cover multiple different dimensions of deprivation, often called domains. Common domains include employment, income, social class …},

In addition to classical approaches such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression and a spatial lag model, we explore the potential of the Gradient Boost Regressor and Random Forests to improve predictive performance and accuracy. In addition to novel predicting methods, we also introduce tools for model interpretation and evaluation such as feature importance and partial dependence plots, or cross-validation. Our results show that Ran- dom Forest proved to be the best model with an R2 of around 0.54, followed by Gradient Boost Regressor with 0.5. Both the spatial lag model and the OLS fall behind with signifi- cantly lower performances of 0.43 and 0.3, respectively.},

The present study has attempted to present and compare the regional pattern of deprivation in rural India by formulating a simple summary index of multidimensional deprivation (IMD) at the district level using global principal component analysis (PCA) and a Geographically Weighted Principal Component Analysis (GWPCA). The results of the study show that the east-central heartland of India is the most deprived region. On the contrary, the north and south India are in a much better position compared to the other part of the country. The results of the spatial autocorrelation of multidimensional deprivation (Global Moran's I~=~0.748) indicates that there is a statistically significant pattern of spatial clustering that includes four distinct categories (High-High, Low-Low, High-Low, and Low-High). The LISA map shows that 151 districts belong to High-High (deprivation hotspots) and 108 districts come under the Low-Low cluster (deprivation cold spots). High-High cluster group spreads along with the ecologically sensitive areas like the Bastar region, Tarai tract, Chotonagpur region, and Dandakaranya region which are dominated by tribal populations.},

  abstract = {Objective Switzerland has mountains and valleys complicating the access to a hospital and critical care in case of emergencies. Treatment success for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or stroke depends on timely treatment. We examined the relationship between distance to different hospital types and mortality from AMI or stroke in the Swiss National Cohort (SNC) Study. Design and setting The SNC is a longitudinal mortality study of the census 2000 population of Switzerland. For 4.5 million Swiss residents not living in a nursing home and older than 30 years in the year 2000, we calculated driving time and straight-line distance from their home to the nearest acute, acute with emergency room, central and university hospital (in total 173 hospitals). On the basis of quintiles, we used multivariable Cox proportional hazard models to estimate HRs of AMI and stroke mortality for driving time distance groups compared to the closest distance group. Results Over 8 years, 19 301 AMI and 21 931 stroke deaths occurred. Mean driving time to the nearest acute hospital was 6.5 min (29.7 min to a university hospital). For AMI mortality, driving time to a university hospital showed the strongest association among the four types of hospitals with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.19 (95\% CI 1.10 to 1.30) and 1.10 (95\% CI 1.01 to 1.20) for men and women aged 65+ years when comparing the highest quintile with the lowest quintile of driving time. For stroke mortality, the association with university hospital driving time was less pronounced than for AMI mortality and did not show a clear incremental pattern with increasing driving time. There was no association with driving time to the nearest hospital. Conclusions The increasing AMI mortality with increasing driving time to the nearest university hospital but not to any nearest hospital reflects a complex interplay of many factors along the care pathway.},

We used a finite mixture modelling approach with 16 indicators from several administrative sources. We found four types of neighbourhoods: Decreasing Socioeconomic Status (SES) areas with increased diversity and decreased socioeconomic status; New Housing/Gentrification areas with high residential mobility, new housing construction and with markers of gentrification in the crisis epoch; Increasing SES areas with increased socioeconomic status and decreased diversity; and Aging areas with an aging population, low residential mobility and no new construction. We describe the baseline predictors of these types of change, finding that there is a potential widening of socioeconomic gaps, as Increasing SES areas start with higher SES, and Decreasing SES areas start with lower SES. We found a change in the spatial distribution of these types between the first and second epochs, as New Housing/Gentrification areas became more common in the centre of the city. We discuss two potential applications of this type of model to the study of the consequences of residential environment changes for health determinants and health outcomes, with a particular emphasis on retail food environments and diabetes incidence.},

A comprehensive set of factors at different levels of influence across the ecological model were taken into account and analysed for mediating and modifying effects. Analyses were based on 1306 children and adolescents (6\&ndash;16 years) participating in the population-based SOPHYA-study. Accelerometers were used to assess SBT, the perceived environment was examined by a validated parental questionnaire, and objective environmental data were allocated using GIS (ArcMap 10.2, Esri, Redlands, CA, USA) for each family\&rsquo;s residential address. A high perceived safety was associated with less SBT. Boys, those whose residential neighbourhood was characterized by dead ends in urban areas, a low main street density in the neighbourhood of children and greenness were less likely to exhibit SBT. The association of the objective environment with the respective parental perceptions was low and no significant mediating effect was found for the perceived environment. We conclude for land-use planning to reduce sedentary behaviour objective environments should be complemented with efforts to increase parental sense of security.},

We tested whether the objectively-assessed built and social environment was associated with PA and SB in Swiss youth and whether sex, age and the socioeconomic position (Swiss-SEP) modified such associations. Methods: We combined data of 1742 youth (ages 4 to 17) from seven studies conducted within Switzerland between 2005-2010. All youth provided accelerometer data and a home address, which was linked to objective environmental data and the Swiss-SEP-index. Associations between neighborhood attributes and PA were analyzed by multivariable multilevel regression analyses. Results: The extent of green areas and building density was positively associated with PA in the total sample (p. {$<$}. 0.05). Factors representing centrally located areas, and more schoolchildren living nearby tended to increase PA in secondary schoolchildren, boys and those from lower-ranked socioeconomic areas. In primary schoolchildren, the extent of green areas was positively associated with PA (p. = 0.05). Associations between neighborhood attributes and PA were more pronounced in youth from low socioeconomic areas. Conclusions: The results indicate that some associations between neighborhood attributes and PA differ by age, sex and socioeconomic area. This should be taken into account when planning interventions to increase childhood PA.},

Different techniques are commonly applied to construct deprivation indices, including multi-criteria decision methods such as the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). The multi-criteria deprivation index for the city of Quito is an index in which indicators are weighted by applying the AHP. In this research, a variation of this index is introduced that is calculated using interval AHP methodology. Both indices are compared by applying logistic generalized linear models and multilevel models, considering self-reported health as the dependent variable and deprivation and self-reported quality of life as the independent variables. The obtained results show that the multi-criteria deprivation index for the city of Quito is a meaningful measure to assess neighborhood effects on self-reported health and that the alternative deprivation index using the interval AHP methodology more thoroughly represents the local knowledge of experts and stakeholders. These differences could support decision makers in improving health planning and in tackling health inequalities in more deprived areas.},

However, the impact of adverse collective circumstances – such as the socio-economic context where people live - is less well understood. This systematic review explores the extent to which area-level socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with inequalities in suicidal behaviour and self-harm in Europe. We performed a systematic review (in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, EconLit and Social Sciences Citation Index) from 2005 to 2015. Observational studies were included if they were based in Europe and had a primary suicidal behaviour and self-harm outcome, compared at least two areas, included an area-level measure of socio-economic disadvantage and were published in the English language. The review followed The Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines for quality appraisal. We identified 27 studies (30 papers) from 14 different European countries. There was a significant association (in 25/27 studies, all of which were rated as of medium or high quality) between socioeconomic disadvantage and suicidal behaviour (and self-harm), particularly for men, and this was a consistent finding across a variety of European countries. Socio-economic disadvantage was found to have an independent effect in several studies whilst others found evidence of mediating contextual and compositional factors. There is strong evidence of an association between suicidal behaviours (and self-harm) and area-level socio-economic disadvantage in Europe, particularly for men. Suicide prevention strategies should take this into account.},

The routine data sources provide information for a range of health measures which are shown to be strongly linked to levels of deprivation, with specific causes--respiratory conditions, cancer of the lung and cancer of the cervix--exhibiting very considerable differentials in respect of both mortality and cancer morbidity. Nevertheless not all causes exhibit this positive association. This area-based measure provides a valuable tool for the analysis of health data in relation to socio-economic circumstances which overcomes many of the limitations which arise in the use of the more traditional measure of social class. Like social class however it depends on data from the census which are available only at ten-yearly intervals. Other existing data sources are suggested which could possibly provide relevant information on area characteristics and populations for inter-censal years.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Residential property is reported as the most valuable asset people will own and therefore provides the potential to be used as a socio-economic status (SES) measure. Location is generally recognised as the most important determinant of residential property value.Extending the well-established relationship between poor health and socio-economic disadvantage and the role of residential property in the overall wealth of individuals, this study tested the predictive value of the Relative Location Factor (RLF), a SES measure designed to reflect the relationship between location and residential property value, and six cardiometabolic disease risk factors, central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL), hypertension, impaired fasting glucose, and high low density lipoprotein (LDL). These risk factors were also summed and expressed as a cumulative cardiometabolic risk (CMR) score.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: RLF was calculated using a global hedonic regression model from residential property sales transaction data based upon several residential property characteristics, but deliberately blind to location, to predict the selling price of the property. The predicted selling price was divided by the actual selling price and the results interpolated across the study area and classified as tertiles. The measures used to calculate CMR were collected via clinic visits from a population-based cohort study. Models with individual risk factors and the cumulative cardiometabolic risk (CMR) score as dependent variables were respectively tested using log binomial and Poisson generalised linear models.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: A statistically significant relationship was found between RLF, the cumulative CMR score and all but one of the risk factors. In all cases, participants in the most advantaged and intermediate group had a lower risk for cardio-metabolic diseases. For the CMR score the RR for the most advantaged was 19\% lower (RR = 0.81; CI 0.76-0.86; p {$<$}0.0001) and the middle group was 9\% lower (RR = 0.91; CI 0.86-0.95; p {$<$}0.0001) than the least advantaged group.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: This paper advances the understanding of the nexus between place, health and SES by providing an objective spatially informed SES measure for testing health outcomes and reported a robust association between RLF and several health measures.},

  abstract = {Climate is a key resource for many types of tourism and as such can be measured and evaluated. An index approach is required for this task because of the multifaceted nature of weather and the complex ways that weather variables come together to give meaning to climate for tourism. Here we address the deficiencies of past indices by devising a theoretically sound and empirically tested method that integrates the various facets of climate and weather into a single index called the Climate Index for Tourism (CIT). CIT rates the climate resource for activities that are highly climate/weather sensitive, specifically, beach "sun, sea and sand" (3S) holidays. CIT integrates thermal (T), aesthetic (A) and physical (P) facets of weather, which are combined in a weather typology matrix to determine a climate satisfaction rating that ranges from very poor (1=unacceptable) to very good (7=optimal). Parameter A refers to sky condition and P to rain or high wind. T is the body-atmosphere energy balance that integrates the environmental and physiological thermal variables, such as solar heat load, heat loss by convection (wind) and by evaporation (sweating), longwave radiation exchange and metabolic heat (activity level). Rather than use T as a net energy (calorific) value, CIT requires that it be expressed as thermal sensation using the standard nine-point ASHRAE scale ("very hot" to "very cold"). In this way, any of the several body-atmosphere energy balance schemes available may be used, maximizing the flexibility of the index. A survey (N=331) was used to validate the initial CIT. Respondents were asked to rate nine thermal states (T) with different sky conditions (A). They were also asked to assess the impact of high winds or prolonged rain on the perceived quality of the overall weather condition. The data was analysed statistically to complete the weather typology matrix, which covered every possible combination of T, A and P. Conditions considered to be optimal (CIT class 6-7) for 3S tourism were those that were "slightly warm" with clear skies or scattered cloud (},

Recently, online companies such as Zillow have developed proprietary systems that provide automated estimates of housing prices without the immediate need of professional appraisers. Yet, our understanding of what drives the value of houses is very limited. In this paper, we use multiple sources of data to entangle the economic contribution of the neighborhood's characteristics such as walkability and security perception. We also develop and release a framework able to now-cast housing prices from Open data, without the need for historical transactions. Experiments involving 70,000 houses in 8 Italian cities highlight that the neighborhood's vitality and walkability seem to drive more than 20\% of the housing value. Moreover, the use of this information improves the nowcast by 60\%. Hence, the use of property's surroundings' characteristics can be an invaluable resource to appraise the economic and social value of houses after neighborhood changes and, potentially, anticipate gentrification.},

Night-time light remote sensing data has been shown to correlate with national-level figures of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Night-time radiance data is analysed here along with regional economic productivity data for 11 European Union countries along with the United States at a number of sub-national levels. Night-time light imagery was found to correlate with Gross Regional Product (GRP) across a range of spatial scales. Maps of economic activity at 5 km resolution were produced based on the derived relationships. To produce these maps, certain areas had to be excluded due to their anomalously high levels of economic activity for the amount of total radiance present. These areas were treated separately from other areas in the map. These results provide the first detailed examination of night-time light characteristics with respect to local economic activity and highlight issues, which should be considered when undertaking such analysis. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Information was obtained on the publication and methodology (design and study areas, information sources, health and socioeconomic indicators, and statistical analysis). Results: We included 142 studies published since 1988 (58.4\% since 2005). More than half (59.9\%) were in English. The level of analysis was ecological in 73.2\% and multilevel in 19.0\%. The areas most frequently analyzed were census tracts (35 studies), especially within cities or autonomous regions, followed by the provinces (30 studies), mostly concerning Spain overall.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Accessing high-resolution, timely socioeconomic data such as data on population, employment, and enterprise activity at the neighborhood level is critical for social scientists and policy makers to design and implement location-based policies. However, in many developing countries or cities, reliable local-scale socioeconomic data remain scarce. Here, we show an easily accessible and timely updated location attribute—restaurant—can be used to accurately predict a range of socioeconomic attributes of urban neighborhoods. We merge restaurant data from an online platform with 3 microdatasets for 9 Chinese cities. Using features extracted from restaurants, we train machine-learning models to estimate daytime and nighttime population, number of firms, and consumption level at various spatial resolutions. The trained model can explain 90 to 95\% of the variation of those attributes across neighborhoods in the test dataset. We analyze the tradeoff between accuracy, spatial resolution, and number of training samples, as well as the heterogeneity of the predicted results across different spatial locations, demographics, and firm industries. Finally, we demonstrate the cross-city generality of this method by training the model in one city and then applying it directly to other cities. The transferability of this restaurant model can help bridge data gaps between cities, allowing all cities to enjoy big data and algorithm dividends.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health has recommended vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) to prevent cervical cancer since 2008. To establish monitoring of the future public health impact of vaccination, baseline population-based data are required. The objectives of this study were to examine the distribution of oncogenic HPV genotypes in biopsies with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia stage 3 or more severe lesions (CIN3+) at the beginning of HPV vaccination programmes and to compare sociodemographic and behavioural factors of women with CIN3+ with women in the Swiss general population. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective and prospective cross-sectional study with women diagnosed with CIN3+ in Switzerland. Ten pathology institutes from six cantons and three language regions participated. We conducted HPV typing on formaldehyde fixed-paraffin embedded specimens from 2014 and 2015. Women enrolled in 2015 were asked to complete a questionnaire. We described frequencies of HPV types. We also compared demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status in the CIN3 + plus group with the Swiss National Cohort in 2014 and compared risk factors for HPV infection with the Swiss Health Survey in 2012. RESULTS: We included 768 biopsies from 767 women. Four hundred and seventy-five (61.8\%) biopsies were positive for HPV 16 and/or 18, 687 (89.5\%) were positive for oncogenic HPV genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and/or 58 and five (0.7\%) were HPV negative. Twenty-eight (10.3\%) of the 273 women who completed the patient questionnaire reported having received at least one dose of an HPV vaccine. When compared with Swiss women in the six study cantons, fewer women in the CIN3+ plus study group were of Swiss nationality, more were born abroad and more were single. The study group also had a higher proportion of women with {$>$}/=2 partners in the last year, current smokers and was younger at age of first sexual intercourse. CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of the nonavalent vaccine could cover approximately 90\% of CIN3+ lesions in Swiss women compared with around 60\% with the quadrivalent vaccine. Surveillance of HPV genotype distribution in CIN3+, together with information about vaccination and CIN3+ incidence will allow monitoring of the public health impact of vaccination programmes.

Height, weight and BMI reference curves were created using the LMS method. Derived percentiles were compared with those of Prader, WHO and neighbouring countries.Results: Growth in the first 5 years is almost identical with Prader curves. Thereafter children are taller, yet their final height is only about 1 cm higher. Today’s children, in particular boys, are considerably heavier. In comparison with WHO growth references, Swiss children are taller from the second year until adulthood; the WHO 3rd percentiles lie about 4 cm below those of our updated references. Weight and BMI median percentiles from our sample are similar to those of WHO and higher than the Prader curves. However, the course of the 97th BMI percentile WHO curves extends well below the 97th percentile of the updated Swiss curves.Conclusion: This study provides contemporary reference data for assessing individual growth based on height, weight and BMI of Swiss children.},

  abstract = {For the past 20 years, the New Zealand Deprivation Index (NZDep) has been the universal measure of area-based social circumstances for New Zealand (NZ) and often the key social determinant used in population health and social research. This paper presents the first theoretical and methodological shift in the measurement of area deprivation in New Zealand since the 1990s and describes the development of the New Zealand Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). We briefly describe the development of Data Zones, an intermediary geographical scale, before outlining the development of the New Zealand Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), which uses routine datasets and methods comparable to current international deprivation indices. We identified 28 indicators of deprivation from national health, social development, taxation, education, police databases, geospatial data providers and the 2013 Census, all of which represented seven Domains of deprivation: Employment; Income; Crime; Housing; Health; Education; and Geographical Access. The IMD is the combination of these seven Domains. The Domains may be used individually or in combination, to explore the geography of deprivation and its association with a given health or social outcome. Geographic variations in the distribution of the IMD and its Domains were found among the District Health Boards in NZ, suggesting that factors underpinning overall deprivation are inconsistent across the country. With the exception of the Access Domain, the IMD and its Domains were statistically and moderately-to-strongly associated with both smoking rates and household poverty. The IMD provides a more nuanced view of area deprivation circumstances in Aotearoa NZ. Our vision is for the IMD and the Data Zones to be widely used to inform research, policy and resource allocation projects, providing a better measurement of area deprivation in NZ, improved outcomes for Māori, and a more consistent approach to reporting and monitoring the social climate of NZ.},

  abstract = {Air pollution is an important risk factor for global burden of disease. There has been recent interest in its possible role in the etiology of diabetes mellitus. Experimental evidence is suggestive, but epidemiological evidence is limited and mixed. We therefore explored the association between air pollution and prevalent diabetes, in a population-based Swiss cohort. We did cross-sectional analyses of 6392 participants of the Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults [SAPALDIA], aged between 29 and 73years. We used estimates of average individual home outdoor PM10 [particulate matter {$<$}10??m in diameter] and NO2 [nitrogen dioxide] exposure over the 10years preceding the survey. Their association with diabetes was modeled using mixed logistic regression models, including participants' study area as random effect, with incremental adjustment for confounders. There were 315 cases of diabetes (prevalence: 5.5\% [95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.8, 7.2\%]). Both PM10 and NO2 were associated with prevalent diabetes with respective odds ratios of 1.40 [95\% CI: 1.17, 1.67] and 1.19 [95\% CI: 1.03, 1.38] per 10??g/m3 increase in the average home outdoor level. Associations with PM10 were generally stronger than with NO2, even in the two-pollutant model. There was some indication that beta blockers mitigated the effect of PM10. The associations remained stable across different sensitivity analyses. Our study adds to the evidence that long term air pollution exposure is associated with diabetes mellitus. PM10 appears to be a useful marker of aspects of air pollution relevant for diabetes. This association can be observed at concentrations below air quality guidelines. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Exposure to ambient air pollution (AP) exposure has been linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. Evidence on the impact of T2D genetic variants on AP susceptibility is lacking. Compared to single variants, joint genetic variants contribute substantially to disease risk. We investigated the modification of AP and diabetes association by a genetic risk score (GRS) covering 63 T2D genes in 1524 first follow-up participants of the Swiss cohort study on air pollution and lung and heart diseases in adults. Genome-wide data and covariates were available from a nested asthma case-control study design. AP was estimated as 10-year mean residential particulate matter {$<$}10 ??m (PM10). We computed count-GRS and weighted-GRS, and applied PM10 interaction terms in mixed logistic regressions, on odds of diabetes. Analyses were stratified by pathways of diabetes pathology and by asthma status. Diabetes prevalence was 4.6\% and mean exposure to PM10 was 22 ??g/m3. Odds of diabetes increased by 8\% (95\% confidence interval: 2, 14\%) per T2D risk allele and by 35\% (-8, 97\%) per 10 ??g/m3 exposure to PM10. We observed a positive interaction between PM10 and count-GRS on diabetes [ORinteraction = 1.10 (1.01, 1.20)], associations being strongest among participants at the highest quartile of count-GRS [OR: 1.97 (1.00, 3.87)]. Stronger interactions were observed with variants of the GRS involved in insulin resistance [(ORinteraction = 1.22 (1.00, 1.50)] than with variants related to beta-cell function. Interactions with count-GRS were stronger among asthma cases. We observed similar results with weighted-GRS. Five single variants near GRB14, UBE2E2, PTPRD, VPS26A and KCNQ1 showed nominally significant interactions with PM10 (P {$<$} 0.05). Our results suggest that genetic risk for T2D may modify susceptibility to air pollution through alterations in insulin sensitivity. These results need confirmation in diabetes cohort consortia.},

However, epidemiologic evidence on associations of objective transportation noise exposure and also perceived noise annoyance with respiratory morbidity is limited. We investigated independent associations of transportation noise exposure and noise annoyance with prevalent respiratory symptoms and incident asthma in adults. Using 17,138 observations (from 7049 participants) from three SAPALDIA (Swiss Cohort Study on Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults) surveys, we assessed associations of transportation noise exposure and noise annoyance with prevalent respiratory symptoms, and with incident asthma (in 10,657 nested observations from 6377 participants). Annual day-evening-night transportation noise comprising road, railway and aircraft Lden (Transportation Lden) was calculated for the most exposed façade of participants' residence using Swiss noise models. Transportation noise annoyance was assessed using an 11-point scale, and participants reported respiratory symptoms and doctor-diagnosed asthma at each survey. We estimated associations with transportation Lden (as well as source-specific Lden) and noise annoyance, independent of air pollution and other potential confounders, using mutually-adjusted mixed logistic and Poisson models and applying random intercepts at the level of the participants. Prevalent respiratory symptoms ranged from 5\% (nocturnal dyspnoea) to 23\% (regular cough/phlegm). Transportation noise annoyance, but not Lden, was independently associated with respiratory symptoms and current asthma in all participants, with odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) ranging between 1.03 (95\%CI: 1.01, 1.06) and 1.07 (95\% CI: 1.04, 1.11) per 1-point difference in noise annoyance. Both noise annoyance and Lden showed independent associations with asthma symptoms among asthmatics, especially in those reporting adult-onset asthma [ORLden: 1.90 (95\% CI: 1.25, 2.89) per 10 dB; p-value of interaction (adult-onset vs. childhood-onset): 0.03; ORnoise annoyance: 1.06 (95\%CI: 0.97, 1.16) per 1-point difference; p-value of interaction: 0.06]. No associations were found with incident asthma. Transportation noise level and annoyance contributed to symptom exacerbation in adult asthma. This suggests both psychological and physiological noise reactions on the respiratory system, and could be relevant for asthma care. More studies are needed to better understand the effects of objective and perceived noise in asthma aetiology and overall respiratory health.},

  abstract = {Prospective evidence on the risk of depression in relation to transportation noise exposure and noise annoyance is limited and mixed. We aimed to investigate the associations of long-term exposure to source-specific transportation noise and noise annoyance with incidence of depression in the SAPALDIA (Swiss cohort study on air pollution and lung and heart diseases in adults) cohort. We investigated 4,581 SAPALDIA participants without depression in the year 2001/2002. Corresponding one-year mean road, railway and aircraft day-evening-night noise (Lden) was calculated at the most exposed façade of the participants’ residential floors, and transportation noise annoyance was assessed on an 11-point scale. Incident cases of depression were identified in 2010/2011, and comprised participants reporting physician diagnosis, intake of antidepressant medication or having a short form-36 mental health score~{$<~$}50. We used robust Poisson regressions to estimate the mutually adjusted relative risks (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) of depression, independent of traffic-related air pollution and other potential confounders. Incidence of depression was 11 cases per 1,000 person-years. In single exposure models, we observed positive but in part, statistically non-significant associations (per 10~dB) of road traffic Lden [RR: 1.06 (0.93, 1.22)] and aircraft Lden [RR: 1.19 (0.93, 1.53)], and (per 1-point difference) of noise annoyance [RR: 1.05 (1.02, 1.08)] with depression risk. In multi-exposure model, noise annoyance effect remained unchanged, with weaker effects of road traffic Lden [(RR: 1.02 (0.89, 1.17)] and aircraft Lden [(RR: 1.17 (0.90, 1.50)]. However, there were statistically significant indirect effects of road traffic Lden [(β: 0.02 (0.01, 0.03)] and aircraft Lden [β: 0.01 (0.002, 0.02)] via noise annoyance. There were no associations with railway Lden in the single and multi-exposure models [(RRboth models: 0.88 (0.75, 1.03)]. We made similar findings among 2,885 non-movers, where the effect modification and cumulative risks were more distinct. Noise annoyance effect in non-movers was stronger among the insufficiently active (RR: 1.09; 95\%CI: 1.02, 1.17; pinteraction~=~0.07) and those with daytime sleepiness [RR: 1.07 (1.02, 1.12); pinteraction~=~0.008]. Cumulative risks of Lden in non-movers showed additive tendencies for the linear cumulative risk [(RRper 10dB of combined sources: 1.31 (0.90, 1.91)] and the categorical cumulative risk [(RRtriple- vs. zero-source ≥45 dB: 2.29 (1.02, 5.14)], and remained stable to noise annoyance. Transportation noise level and noise annoyance may jointly and independently influence the risk of depression. Combined long-term exposures to noise level seems to be most detrimental, largely acting via annoyance. The moderation of noise annoyance effect by daytime sleepiness and physical activity further contribute to clarifying the involved mechanisms. More evidence is needed to confirm these findings for effective public health control of depression and noise exposure burden.},

We hypothesize that night-time road traffic noise (RTN) may impair glucose homeostasis through circadian rhythm disturbances. We prospectively investigated the relationship between residential night-time RTN and subsequent eight-year change in glycosylated hemoglobin (ΔHbA1c) in 3350 participants of the Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults (SAPALDIA), adjusting for diabetes risk factors and air pollution levels. Annual average RTN (Lnight) was assigned to participants in 2001 using validated Swiss noise models. HbA1c was measured in 2002 and 2011 using liquid chromatography. We applied mixed linear models to explore RTN-ΔHbA1c association and its modification by a genetic risk score of six common circadian-related MTNR1B variants (MGRS). A 10 dB difference in RTN was associated with a 0.02\% (0.003-0.04\%) increase in mean ΔHbA1c in 2142 non-movers. RTN-ΔHbA1c association was modified by MGRS among diabetic participants (Pinteraction = 0.001). A similar trend in non-diabetic participants was non-significant. Among the single variants, we observed strongest interactions with rs10830963, an acknowledged diabetes risk variant also implicated in melatonin profile dysregulation. Night-time RTN may impair glycemic control, especially in diabetic individuals, through circadian rhythm disturbances. Experimental sleep studies are needed to test whether noise control may help individuals to attain optimal glycemic levels.},

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is inflammatory and precedes cardiovascular morbidity and type 2 diabetes. Thus, a positive association between AP and MetS may be hypothesized. We explored this association, (taking into account, pathway-specific MetS definitions), and its potential modifiers in Swiss adults. We studied 3769 participants of the Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults, reporting at least four-hour fasting time before venepuncture. AP exposures were 10-year mean residential PM10 (particulate matter {$<$}10𝜇m in diameter) and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide). Outcomes included MetS defined by World Health Organization (MetS-W), International Diabetes Federation (MetS-I) and Adult Treatment Panel-III (MetS-A) using four- and eight-hour fasting time limits. We also explored associations with individual components of MetS. We applied mixed logistic regression models to explore these associations. The prevalence of MetS-W, MetS-I and MetS-A were 10\%, 22\% and 18\% respectively. Odds of MetS-W, MetS-I and MetS-A increased by 72\% (51-102\%), 31\% (11-54\%) and 18\% (4-34\%) per 10𝜇g/m3 increase in 10-year mean PM10. We observed weaker associations with NO2. Associations were stronger among physically-active, ever-smokers and non-diabetic participants especially with PM10 (p{$<$}0.05). Associations remained robust across various sensitivity analyses including ten imputations of missing observations and exclusion of diabetes cases. The observed associations between AP exposure and MetS were sensitive to MetS definitions. Regarding the MetS components, we observed strongest associations with impaired fasting glycemia, and positive but weaker associations with hypertension and waist-circumference-based obesity. Cardio-metabolic effects of AP may be majorly driven by impairment of glucose homeostasis, and to a less-strong extent, visceral adiposity. Well-designed prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.},

  abstract = {Background Living at higher altitude was dose-dependently associated with lower risk of ischaemic heart disease (IHD). Higher altitudes have different climatic, topographic and built environment properties than lowland regions. It is unclear whether these environmental factors mediate/confound the association between altitude and IHD. We examined how much of the altitude-IHD association is explained by variations in exposure at place of residence to sunshine, temperature, precipitation, aspect, slope and distance to main road. Methods We included 4.2 million individuals aged 40–84 at baseline living in Switzerland at altitudes 195–2971 m above sea level (ie, full range of residence), providing 77 127 IHD deaths. Mortality data 2000–2008, sociodemographic/economic information and coordinates of residence were obtained from the Swiss National Cohort, a longitudinal, census-based record linkage study. Environment information was modelled to residence level using Weibull regression models. Results In the model not adjusted for other environmental factors, IHD mortality linearly decreased with increasing altitude resulting in a lower risk (HR, 95\% CI 0.67, 0.60 to 0.74) for those living {$>$}1500 m (vs{$<$}600 m). This association remained after adjustment for all other environmental factors 0.74 (0.66 to 0.82). Conclusions The benefit of living at higher altitude was only partially confounded by variations in climate, topography and built environment. Rather, physical environment factors appear to have an independent effect and may impact on cardiovascular health in a cumulative way. Inclusion of additional modifiable factors as well as individual information on traditional IHD risk factors in our combined environmental model could help to identify strategies for the reduction of inequalities in IHD mortality.},

We removed all urban areas as identified by the Office for National Statistics Rural–Urban Area Classifications and mapped the Carstairs2011 and IMD2010 across the remaining rural areas using rural-specific quintiles.Our method was effective in displaying much greater heterogeneity in rural areas than was apparent in the original indices.

Tumor stage was classified according to Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program summary stage (in situ/localized/regional/distant). We used highest education level attained to estimate SEP (low/middle/high). Further demographic characteristics of interest were age at presentation (30–49/50–69/70–84 years), living in a canton with organized screening (yes/no), urbanity of residence (urban/peri-urban/rural), civil status (single/married/widowed/divorced) and nationality (Swiss/non-Swiss). We used ordered logistic regression models to analyze factors associated with BC stage at presentation and competing risk regression models for factors associated with survival. Odds of later-stage BC were significantly increased for low SEP women (odds ratio 1.19, 95\%CI 1.06–1.34) compared to women of high SEP. Further, women living in a canton without organized screening program, women diagnosed outside the targeted screening age and single/widowed/divorced women were more often diagnosed at later stages. Women of low SEP experienced an increased risk of dying from BC (sub-hazard ratio 1.22, 95\%CI 1.05–1.43) compared to women of high SEP. Notably, these survival inequalities could not be explained by socioeconomic differences in stage at presentation and/or other sociodemographic factors. It is concerning that these social gradients have been observed in a country with universal health insurance coverage, high health expenditures and one of the highest life expectancies in the world.},

In this paper, we present a machine-learning-enabled approach to predicting the prevalence of six common non-communicable chronic diseases at the census tract level. We apply our approach to the City of Austin and show that our method can yield fairly accurate predictions. In searching for the best predictive models, we experiment with eight different machine learning algorithms and 60 predictor variables that characterize the social environment, the physical environment, and the aspects and degrees of neighborhood disorder. Our analysis suggests that (a) the sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables are the strongest predictors for tract-level health outcomes and (b) the historical records of 311 service requests can be a useful complementary data source as the information distilled from the 311 data often helps improve the models' performance. The machine learning models yielded from this study can help the public and city officials evaluate future scenarios and understand how changes in the neighborhood conditions can lead to changes in the health outcomes. By analyzing where the most significant discrepancies between the predicted and the actual values are, we will also be ready to identify areas of best practice and areas in need of greater investment or policy intervention.},

  abstract = {Background Public health policies aim to prevent suicide in the general population. Assessing their effectiveness is required to further guide public health policies. The present article focuses on the French paradox. The French health care system was classified as the best in the world according the World Health Organization (WHO). However, suicide rates in France remain high compared to other European countries. The aim of the present article was to analyze (i) the evolution of suicide Age-Standardized Death (ASDRs) in France during the last three decades and the associations with socio-economic parameters and (ii) to understand which populations may specifically benefit from further targeted suicide prevention policies. Methods The database of the World Health Organization (WHO), freely available, was explored in April 2015. ASDRs were calculated each year by ratio between the number of deaths by suicide and the total population (per 100,000 inhabitants). Number of deaths by gender and age were also analyzed. Results Overall, ASDR suicide has decreased since 1987 in France (-32.8\% between 1987 and 2010). However, France kept the same rank (10/26) when compared to other European countries between 1987 and 2010. The relative burden of suicide in all-causes mortality increased during the same period (+28.2\%) while the total number of deaths by suicide increased only slightly (+3.9\%). More specifically, the number of deaths by suicide increased substantially in [35-54] years old (+40\%) and 75+ years old (+27\%) males, and in [35-54] (+41\%) years old females. Between 2000 and 2010, suicide rates significantly decreased when yearly mean income increased, and when general and psychiatric care beds decreased. Conclusion Although ASDR suicide has decreased in France since 1987, this decline is quite modest when considering its universal access to care, the prevention of depression and suicide public policies. Suicide prevention public policies should focus on evaluation and improvement of prevention and care in the [35-54] years old population, and in the males aged 75+.},

We assessed 3842 participants (aged 37-81) that attended the three examinations (SAP 1, 2, and 3 in years 1991, 2001 and 2011, respectively) of the population-based Swiss cohort on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults (SAPALDIA). Participants reported general 24-h transportation NA (in all examinations) and source-specific NA at night (only SAP 3) on an ICBEN-type 11-point scale. We assessed moderate, vigorous, and total PA from a short-questionnaire (SAP 3). The main outcome was moderate PA (active/inactive: cut-off ??? 150 min/week). We used logistic regression including random effects by area and adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and lifestyles (main model) and evaluated potential effect modifiers. We analyzed associations with PA at SAP 3 a) cross-sectionally: for source-specific and transportation NA in the last year (SAP 3), and b) longitudinally: for 10-y transportation NA (mean of SAP 1 + 2), adjusting for prior PA (SAP 2) and changes in NA (SAP 3-2). Reported NA (score ??? 5) was 16.4\%, 7.5\%, 3\%, and 1.1\% for 1-year transportation, road, aircraft, and railway at SAP 3, respectively. NA was greater in the past, reaching 28.5\% for 10-y transportation NA (SAP 1 + 2). The 10-y transportation NA was associated with a 3.2\% (95\% CI: 6\%-0.2\%) decrease in moderate PA per 1-NA rating point and was related to road and aircraft NA at night in cross-sectional analyses. The longitudinal association was stronger for women, reported daytime sleepiness or chronic diseases and it was not explained by objectively modeled levels of road traffic noise at SAP 3. In conclusion, long-term NA (related to psychological noise appraisal) reduced PA and could represent another noise pathway towards cardiometabolic diseases.},

  abstract = {Objectives To formulate an index representing area deprivation and elucidate the relation between the index and mortality in Japan. Study design Ecological study for prefectures (N=47) and municipalities (N=3366) across Japan. Methods Based on socioeconomic indicators of seven domains of deprivation (i.e. unemployment, overcrowding, low social class and poverty, low education, no home ownership, low income and vulnerable group), an index was formulated using the z-scoring method. The relation between the index and mortality was examined by correlation analysis, hierarchical Poisson regression and comparison of standardized mortality ratio according to the index. Results The deprivation index ranged from −7.48 to 10.98 for prefectures and from −16.97 to 13.82 for municipalities. The index was significantly positively correlated with prefectural mortality, especially in the population aged under 74 years: r=0.65 for men and r=0.41 for women. At the municipal level, hierarchical Poisson regression showed a significant positive coefficient of the index to mortality for both men and women, and excess mortality in the most deprived fifth compared to the least deprived fifth was 26.4\% in men and 11.8\% in women. Conclusions We formulated a deprivation index, which was substantially related to mortality at the prefectural and municipal levels. This study highlights the higher risk of dying among populations in socially disadvantaged areas and encourages the use of indices representing area socioeconomic conditions for further studies of area effects on health.},

For them to play this role in a multinational context, their construction needs to follow methodological principles that ensure their relevance and comparability across countries. This chapter argues that the Euro-Mediterranean countries can benefit from the European Union (EU) experience in building a common framework for monitoring, understanding and also fighting poverty and social exclusion. As a concrete example, it discusses methodological issues raised by the construction of indicators on material deprivation, defined as an enforced lack of a combination of items depicting some aspects of living conditions related to housing conditions, possession of durables and capacity to afford basic requirements. More specifically, this chapter focuses on the selection of items, their dimensional structure, their aggregation in a synthetic measure and their weighting. It also puts in perspective material deprivation and income-based poverty indicators to emphasise the complementarity of the two approaches when applied to a group of countries with heterogeneous standards of living. It covers 24 EU countries.},

This has generated a search for generic mechanisms that could explain such a general association. However, we propose that there is a greater variation in the association between SEP and health than is generally acknowledged when specific health outcomes are investigated. We propose that studying these variations provide a better understanding of the aetiological mechanisms relating specific diseases with specific exposures.Using different indicators of SEP in health research can better capture these variations and is important when evaluating the full contribution of confounding by socioeconomic conditions. We propose that using an array of SEP indicators within a life course framework also offers considerable opportunity to explore causal pathways in disease aetiology.},

Although a comprehensive source of data, the lag between demographic changes and their appearance in the ACS can exceed half a decade. As digital imagery becomes ubiquitous and machine vision techniques improve, automated data analysis may provide a cheaper and faster alternative. Here, we present a method that determines socioeconomic trends from 50 million images of street scenes, gathered in 200 American cities by Google Street View cars. Using deep learning-based computer vision techniques, we determined the make, model, and year of all motor vehicles encountered in particular neighborhoods. Data from this census of motor vehicles, which enumerated 22M automobiles in total (8\% of all automobiles in the US), was used to accurately estimate income, race, education, and voting patterns, with single-precinct resolution. (The average US precinct contains approximately 1000 people.) The resulting associations are surprisingly simple and powerful. For instance, if the number of sedans encountered during a 15-minute drive through a city is higher than the number of pickup trucks, the city is likely to vote for a Democrat during the next Presidential election (88\% chance); otherwise, it is likely to vote Republican (82\%). Our results suggest that automated systems for monitoring demographic trends may effectively complement labor-intensive approaches, with the potential to detect trends with fine spatial resolution, in close to real time.},

  abstract = {KEY ISSUES--Over one hundred years of social science research has shown that different social groups have different probabilities of suffering from multiple deprivation; yet census based deprivation indices frequently assign equal weightings to each of their component variables. This becomes highly problematic when these indices are used as the basis for allocating resources to local and health authorities. In order to ensure fairness and accuracy in resource allocation these indices should be both weighted and validated. STUDY RESULTS--Weightings are derived from the Breadline Britain in the 1990s survey to produce a census based deprivation index that estimates the percentage of poor households at electoral ward level. Examples of validation methodology are discussed and the estimate of the proportion of poor households is shown to be highly correlated with both low income and morbidity as estimated from the 1991 census. DATA SOURCES--The 1991 census local base statistics (LBS) and small area statistics (SAS) aggregated for the 8519 electoral wards of England. The Breadline Britain in the 1990s survey: a nationally representative survey of 1831 households specifically designed to measure poverty and multiple deprivation.},

Much of the field of Health Geography owes both its direction of development and its initial impetus to his 1842 report. The report presented evidence for the importance of local context to health, with individuals of the lowest occupations in Rutland living longer than individuals of the highest occupations in Liverpool. Here we update the 1842 analysis using data from the Office of National Statistics on individual mortality records by occupation (2010-12) and population data from the 2011 Census. Sex-specific directly standardised premature (16-74) mortality rates were calculated for hierarchical occupational categories similar to Chadwick's categories, for the nearest equivalent areas to those used in Chadwick's report. Although there is no longer consistent evidence on individuals in the lowest occupational group having lower mortality rates than those in the highest group, there were clear social gradients in mortality within each area and the extent of these inequalities varied between areas. Individuals who live in Rutland had lower premature mortality rates across each occupational group compared to the other areas. Our results demonstrate that while life expectancy has nearly doubled since Chadwick's report, social and spatial inequalities in health have persisted. We suggest that Chadwick's legacy on the importance of locality continues.},

Nous avons examiné l'influence du quartier SEP sur la présentation et les résultats chez les personnes VIH-positives dans l'ère de la thérapie antirétrovirale combinée (CART).\textbackslash nMÉTHODES: Le quartier SEP patients suivis dans l'étude suisse VIH cohorte (SHCS) de 2000 à 2013 a été obtenue sur la base des données du recensement de 2000 sur les 50 ménages les plus proches (de l'éducation et de la profession du chef de ménage, le loyer, le nombre de personnes par chambre signifie ). Nous avons utilisé Cox et modèles de régression logistique pour examiner la probabilité de présentation tardive, la réponse virologique au panier, la perte pour le suivi et la mort dans les quintiles de quartier septembre\textbackslash nRÉSULTATS: Un total de 4489 participants SHCS ont été inclus. Présentation à un stade avancé [nombre de cellules CD4⁺ {$<$}200 cellules / ul ou le SIDA] et avec le sida était moins fréquente dans les quartiers Of sept supérieur: l'âge et les chances de sexe rapport ajusté (OR) comparant le plus élevé avec le quintile le plus bas de la SEP a été [intervalle de 95\% de confiance (IC à 95\%) de 0,58 à 0,87] 0,71 et 0,59 (IC à 95\% 0,45 à 0,77), respectivement.

Perte de suivi, la mortalité et les causes de la mort ne sont pas associés avec le quartier septembre\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: présentation tardive était plus fréquente et la réponse virologique au panier moins fréquente chez les personnes séropositives vivant dans les quartiers Of sept inférieur, mais contrairement à la population générale, il n'y avait pas de tendance claire pour la mortalité.\textbackslash n\textbackslash n\textbackslash nOBJECTIVES: Inequalities and inequities in health are an important public health concern. In Switzerland, mortality in the general population varies according to the socio-economic position (SEP) of neighbourhoods. We examined the influence of neighbourhood SEP on presentation and outcomes in HIV-positive individuals in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).\textbackslash nMETHODS: The neighbourhood SEP of patients followed in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) 2000-2013 was obtained on the basis of 2000 census data on the 50 nearest households (education and occupation of household head, rent, mean number of persons per room). We used Cox and logistic regression models to examine the probability of late presentation, virologic response to cART, loss to follow-up and death across quintiles of neighbourhood SEP.\textbackslash nRESULTS: A total of 4489 SHCS participants were included. Presentation with advanced disease [CD4⁺ cell count {$<$}200 cells/𝜇l or AIDS] and with AIDS was less common in neighbourhoods of higher SEP: the age and sex-adjusted odds ratio (OR) comparing the highest with the lowest quintile of SEP was 0.71 [95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 0.58-0.87] and 0.59 (95\% CI 0.45-0.77), respectively. An undetectable viral load at 6 months of cART was more common in the highest than in the lowest quintile (OR 1.52; 95\% CI 1.14-2.04). Loss to follow-up, mortality and causes of death were not associated with neighbourhood SEP.\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Late presentation was more common and virologic response to cART less common in HIV-positive individuals living in neighbourhoods of lower SEP, but in contrast to the general population, there was no clear trend for mortality.},

  abstract = {Background Despite a concerted policy effort in Europe, social inequalities in health are a persistent problem. Developing a standardised measure of socioeconomic level across Europe will improve the understanding of the underlying mechanisms and causes of inequalities. This will facilitate developing, implementing and assessing new and more effective policies, and will improve the comparability and reproducibility of health inequality studies among countries. This paper presents the extension of the European Deprivation Index (EDI), a standardised measure first developed in France, to four other European countries—Italy, Portugal, Spain and England, using available 2001 and 1999 national census data. Methods and results The method previously tested and validated to construct the French EDI was used: first, an individual indicator for relative deprivation was constructed, defined by the minimal number of unmet fundamental needs associated with both objective (income) poverty and subjective poverty. Second, variables available at both individual (European survey) and aggregate (census) levels were identified. Third, an ecological deprivation index was constructed by selecting the set of weighted variables from the second step that best correlated with the individual deprivation indicator. Conclusions For each country, the EDI is a weighted combination of aggregated variables from the national census that are most highly correlated with a country-specific individual deprivation indicator. This tool will improve both the historical and international comparability of studies, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying social inequalities in health and implementation of intervention to tackle social inequalities in health.},

To test this possibility, we investigated how variation in store-level food sales composition across Switzerland is associated with the mean Body Mass Index (BMI) of young men (Swiss Army conscripts) living near the stores. We obtained data on annual food sales (2011) for 553 stores from the largest supermarket chain in Switzerland, identified foods commonly regarded as \&ldquo;healthy\&rdquo; or \&ldquo;unhealthy\&rdquo; based on nutrient content, and determined their contribution to each store\&rsquo;s total sales (Swiss francs). We found that the sales percentages of both \&ldquo;healthy\&rdquo; and \&ldquo;unhealthy\&rdquo; food types varied by 2- to 3-fold among stores. Their balance ranged from \&minus;15.3\% to 18.0\% of total sales; it was positively associated with area-based socioeconomic position (r = 0.63) and negatively associated with the mean BMI of young men in the area (r = \&minus;0.42). Thus, even though we compared supermarkets from a single chain, different shopping behaviors of customers caused stores in privileged areas to sell relatively more healthy food. Knowledge about such patterns could help in designing in-store interventions for healthier nutrition and monitoring their effects over time.},

Little is known about which life domains—measured as domain satisfactions—contribute most to GLS and are the best predictors of self-rated health (SRH) and whether these associations differ between countries and/or language areas. We used stepwise logistic regression models to investigate how domain satisfactions, GLS and SRH are interrelated and compared German-speaking and French/Italian-speaking Switzerland with the corresponding neighboring countries of Germany, Austria, France and Italy. The associations of domain satisfactions with GLS and SRH varied significantly in magnitude and between countries and language areas. GLS was strongly related to self-rated health in all populations, but more so in the German-speaking than the French/Italian-speaking regions. Adjusted for all domain satisfactions, satisfaction with one’s financial situation and job satisfaction showed independent effects on SRH and were the most important predictors of GLS, although no clear geographical pattern emerged. Domain-specific satisfactions were similarly associated with GLS and SRH, but the strength of the association varied between German-, French- and Italian-speaking populations. Any similarity between Swiss language areas and neighboring countries was limited to German-speaking populations. Country- and language-specific life domain satisfactions may provide useful pointers for targeting policies in the respective domains.},

This work focuses on the methodological aspects of the development and validation of a French small-area index of socioeconomic deprivation and its application to the evaluation of the socioeconomic differentials in health outcomes. This index was derived from a principal component analysis of 1999 national census data from the Strasbourg metropolitan area in eastern France, at the census block level. Composed of 19 variables that reflect the multiple aspects of socioeconomic status (income, employment, housing, family and household, and educational level), it can discriminate disadvantaged urban centres from more privileged rural and suburban areas. Several statistical tests (Cronbach's alpha coefficient, convergent validity tests with other deprivation indices from the literature) provided internal and external validation. Its successful application to another French metropolitan area (Lille, in northern France) confirmed its transposability. Finally, its capacity to capture the social inequalities in health when applied to myocardial infarction data shows its potential value. This study thus provides a new tool in French public health research for characterising neighbourhood deprivation and detecting socioeconomic disparities in the distribution of health outcomes at the small-area level.},

  abstract = {The present study aimed to disentangle the risk of the three major transportation noise sources—road, railway, and aircraft traffic—and the air pollutants NO2 and PM2.5 on myocardial infarction (MI) mortality in Switzerland based on high quality/fine resolution exposure modelling.We modelled long-term exposure to outdoor road traffic, railway, and aircraft noise levels, as well as NO2 and PM2.5 concentration for each address of the 4.40 million adults (\&gt;30 years) in the Swiss National Cohort (SNC). We investigated the association between transportation noise/air pollution exposure and death due to MI during the follow-up period 2000–08, by adjusting noise [Lden(Road), Lden(Railway), and Lden(Air)] estimates for NO2 and/or PM2.5 and vice versa by multipollutant Cox regression models considering potential confounders. Adjusting noise risk estimates of MI for NO2 and/or PM2.5 did not change the hazard ratios (HRs) per 10 dB increase in road traffic (without air pollution: 1.032, 95\% CI: 1.014–1.051, adjusted for NO2 and PM2.5: 1.034, 95\% CI: 1.014–1.055), railway traffic (1.020, 95\% CI: 1.007–1.033 vs. 1.020, 95\% CI: 1.007–1.033), and aircraft traffic noise (1.025, 95\% CI: 1.006–1.045 vs. 1.025, 95\% CI: 1.005–1.046). Conversely, noise adjusted HRs for air pollutants were lower than corresponding estimates without noise adjustment. Hazard ratio per 10 μg/m³ increase with and without noise adjustment were 1.024 (1.005–1.043) vs. 0.990 (0.965–1.016) for NO2 and 1.054 (1.013–1.093) vs. 1.019 (0.971–1.071) for PM2.5.Our study suggests that transportation noise is associated with MI mortality, independent from air pollution. Air pollution studies not adequately adjusting for transportation noise exposure may overestimate the cardiovascular disease burden of air pollution.},

  abstract = {Background: Most epidemiological noise studies consider 24 h average noise exposure levels. Our aim was to exploratively analyze the impact of noise exposure at different time windows during day and night on cardiovascular mortality. Methods: We generated Switzerland-wide exposure models for road traffic, railway and aircraft noise for different time windows for the year 2001. Combined noise source equivalent continuous sound levels (Leq) for different time windows at the most exposed façade were assigned to each of the 4.41 million Swiss National Cohort adult participants. Follow-up period was from 2000 to 2008. Hazard ratios (HR) of noise effects on various cardiovascular primary causes of death were computed by Cox regression models adjusted for potential confounders and NO2levels. Results: For most cardiovascular causes of death we obtained indications for a diurnal pattern. For ischemic heart disease the highest HR was observed for the core night hours from 01 h to 05 h (HR per standard deviation of Leq: 1.025, 95\% CI: 1.016–1.034) and lower HR for the daytime 07 h to 19 h (1.018 [1.009–1.028]). Heart failure and daytime Leqyielded the highest HR (1.047 [1.027–1.068]). Conclusion: For acute cardiovascular diseases, nocturnal intermittent noise exposure tended to be more relevant than daytime exposure, whereas it was the opposite for chronic conditions such as heart failure most strongly associated with continuous daytime noise. This suggests that for acute diseases sleep is an important mediator for health consequences of transportation noise.},

With this work, we examine how these traces and the network structure can reveal the socioeconomic profile of different countries. We take into account multiple international networks of physical and digital flows, including the previously unexplored international postal network. By measuring the position of each country in the Trade, Postal, Migration, International Flights, IP and Digital Communications networks, we are able to build proxies for a number of crucial socioeconomic indicators such as GDP per capita and the Human Development Index ranking along with twelve other indicators used as benchmarks of national wellbeing by the United Nations and other international organisations. In this context, we have also proposed and evaluated a global connectivity degree measure applying multiplex theory across the six networks that accounts for the strength of relationships between countries. We conclude with a multiplex community analysis of the global flow networks, showing how countries with shared community membership over multiple networks have similar socioeconomic profiles. Combining multiple flow data sources into global multiplex networks can help understand the forces which drive economic activity on a global level. Such an ability to infer proxy indicators in a context of incomplete information is extremely timely in light of recent discussions on measurement of indicators relevant to the Sustainable Development Goals.},

It is unclear if this possible link may be explained by exposure to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) or by electrical shocks. We evaluated ALS mortality in 2000-2008 and exposure to ELF-MF and electrical shocks in the Swiss National Cohort, using job exposure matrices for occupations at censuses 1990 and 2000. We compared 2.2 million workers with high or medium vs. low exposure to ELF-MF and electrical shocks using Cox proportional hazard models. Results showed that mortality from ALS was higher in people who had medium or high ELF-MF exposure in both censuses (HR 1.55 (95\% CI 1.11-2.15)), but closer to unity for electrical shocks (HR 1.17 (95\% CI 0.83-1.65)). When both exposures were included in the same model, the HR for ELF-MF changed little (HR 1.56), but the HR for electric shocks was attenuated to 0.97. In conclusion, there was an association between exposure to ELF-MF and mortality from ALS among workers with a higher likelihood of long-term exposure.},

This study brings forth a valuable comparison of SRH between cities that have contrasting urban forms, population compositions, residential segregation, food systems and transportation modes. The SOS (Seattle Obesity Study) was based on a representative sample of 1394 adult residents of Seattle and King County in the United States. The RECORD Study (Residential Environment and Coronary Heart Disease) was based on 7131 adult residents of Paris and its suburbs in France. Socio-demographics, SRH and body weights were obtained from telephone surveys (SOS) and in-person interviews (RECORD). All home addresses were geocoded using ArcGIS 9.3.1 (ESRI, Redlands, CA). Residential property values were obtained from tax records (Seattle) and from real estate sales (Paris). Binary logistic regression models were used to test the associations among demographic and SES variables and SRH. Higher area property values significantly associated with better SRH, adjusting for age, gender, individual education, incomes, and BMI. The associations were significant for both cities. A one-unit increase in body mass index (BMI) was more detrimental to SRH in Seattle than in Paris. In both cities, higher area residential property values were related to a significantly lower obesity risk and better SRH. Ranked residential property values can be useful for health and weight studies, including those involving social inequalities and cross-country comparisons.},

  abstract = {Background Many studies have observed space-time clustering of childhood leukemia (CL) yet few have attempted to elicit etiological clues from such clustering. We recently reported space-time clustering of CL around birth, and now aim to generate etiological hypotheses by comparing clustered and nonclustered cases. We also investigated whether the clustering resulted from many small aggregations of cases or from a few larger clusters. Methods We identified cases of persons born and diagnosed between 1985 and 2014 at age 0-15 years from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. We determined spatial and temporal lags that maximized evidence of clustering based on the Knox test and classified cases born within these lags from another case as clustered. Using logistic regression adjusted for child population density, we determined whether clustering status was associated with age at diagnosis, immunophenotype, cytogenetic subtype, perinatal and socioeconomic characteristics, and pollution sources. Results Analyses included 1,282 cases of which 242 were clustered (born within 1 km and 2 years from another case). Of all investigated characteristics only the t(12; 21)(p13; q22) translocation (resulting in ETV6-RUNX1 fusion) differed significantly in prevalence between clustered and nonclustered cases (40\% and 25\%, respectively; adjusted OR 2.54 \{[\}1.52-4.23]; p = 0.003). Spatio-temporal clustering was driven by an excess of aggregations of two or three children rather than by a few large clusters. Conclusion Our findings suggest ETV6-RUNX1 is associated with space-time clustering of CL and are consistent with an infection interacting with that oncogene in early life leading to clinical leukemia.},

The authors generated diverse single-variable and composite area-based socioeconomic measures at the census tract, block group, and zip code level for Massachusetts (1990 population: 6,016,425) and Rhode Island (1990 population: 1,003,464) to investigate their associations with mortality rates (1989–1991: 156,366 resident deaths in Massachusetts and 27,291 in Rhode Island) and incidence of primary invasive cancer (1988–1992: 140,610 resident cases in Massachusetts; 1989–1992: 19,808 resident cases in Rhode Island). Analyses of all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates and all-cause and site-specific cancer incidence rates indicated that: 1) block group and tract socioeconomic measures performed comparably within and across both states, but zip code measures for several outcomes detected no gradients or gradients contrary to those observed with tract and block group measures; 2) similar gradients were detected with categories generated by quintiles and by a priori categorical cutpoints; and 3) measures including data on economic poverty were most robust and detected gradients that were unobserved using measures of only education and wealth.},

  abstract = {For Germany, regional differences for various health indicators, which are also associated with socioeconomic  factors, have been documented. This article aims to develop a regional socioeconomic deprivation index for  Germany that (1) can be used to analyse regional socioeconomic inequalities in health and (2) provides a basis  for explaining regional health differences in Germany.  The core data stem from the INKAR (indicators and maps on spatial and urban development in Germany and  Europe) database compiled by Germany’s Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial  Development. Factor analysis is used for indexing and the weighting of indicators for the three dimensions of  education, occupation and income. The German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation (GISD) is generated at the  levels of associations of municipalities, administrative districts and administrative regions for the years 1998,  2003, 2008 and 2012. Aggregate data and individual data from the German Health Update 2014/2015-EHIS  (GEDA 2014/2015-EHIS) study are used to analyse associations between the index and selected health indicators.  For around two thirds of the causes of death, the German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation reveals significant  socioeconomic inequalities at the level of Germany’s administrative regions. At district level, life expectancy in  the bottom fifth of districts presenting the highest levels of deprivation is, depending on the observation period,  1.3 years lower for women and 2.6 years lower for men in comparison to the upper fifth of districts presenting  the lowest levels of deprivation. The index can explain 45.5\% and 62.2\% of regional differences in life expectancy  for women and men, respectively. Moreover, the population in regions characterised by high levels of deprivation  has significantly higher rates of smokers, engages less frequently in leisure-time physical activities and is more  often obese.  The German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation illustrates regional socioeconomic differences at different  spatial levels and contributes to explaining regional health differences. This index is intended for use in research  as well as by federal and federal state health reporting systems and should enable access to new sources of data  for investigating the links between social inequalities and health in Germany.},

  abstract = {Objective To identify the relationships between county-level area deprivation and patterns of both opioid prescriptions and drug-poisoning mortality. Design, setting and participants For this retrospective cross-sectional study, we used the IQVIA Xponent data to capture opioid prescriptions and Centres for Disease Control and Prevention National Vital Statistics System to assess drug-poisoning mortality. The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) is a composite measure of social determinants of health comprised of 17 US census indicators, spanning four socioeconomic domains. For all US counties with available opioid prescription (2712 counties) and drug-poisoning mortality (3133 counties) data between 2012 and 2017, we used negative binomial regression to examine the association between quintiles of county-level ADI and the rates of opioid prescriptions and drug-poisoning mortality adjusted for year, age, race and sex. Primary outcome measures County-level opioid prescription fills and drug-poisoning mortality. Results Between 2012 and 2017, overall rates of opioid prescriptions decreased from 96.6 to 72.2 per 100 people, while the rates of drug-poisoning mortality increased from 14.3 to 22.8 per 100 000 people. Opioid prescription and drug-poisoning mortality rates were consistently higher with greater levels of deprivation. The risk of filling an opioid prescription was 72\% higher, and the risk of drug-poisoning mortality was 36\% higher, for most deprived compared with the least deprived counties (both p{$<$}0.001). Discussion Counties with greater area-level deprivation have higher rates of filled opioid prescriptions and drug-poisoning mortality. Although opioid prescription rates declined across all ADI quintiles, the rates of drug-poisoning mortality continued to rise proportionately in each ADI quintile. This underscores the need for individualised and targeted interventions that consider the deprivation of communities where people live.},

  abstract = {Geographical investigations are a core function of public health monitoring, providing the foundation for resource allocation and policies for reducing health inequalities. The aim of this study was to develop geodemographic area classification based on several area-level indicators and to explore the extent of geographical inequalities in mortality. A series of 19 area-level socioeconomic indicators were used from the 2011 national population census. After normalization and standardization of the geographically smoothed indicators, the k-means cluster algorithm was implemented to classify communities into groups based on similar characteristics. The association between geodemographic area classification and the spatial distribution of mortality was estimated in Poisson log-linear spatial models. The k-means algorithm resulted in four distinct clusters of areas. The most characteristic distinction was between the ageing, socially isolated, and resource-scarce rural communities versus metropolitan areas with younger population, higher educational attainment, and professional occupations. By comparison to metropolitan areas, premature mortality appeared to be 44\% (95\% Credible Intervals [CrI] of Rate Ratio (RR): 1.06\&ndash;1.91) higher in traditional rural areas and 36\% (95\% CrI of RR: 1.13\&ndash;1.62) higher in young semi-rural areas. These findings warrant future epidemiological studies investigating various causes of the urban-rural differences in premature mortality and implementation policies to reduce the mortality gap between urban and rural areas.},

Disparities in health status due to socioeconomic conditions are unfair and can be prevented through appropriate health and social policies. The relation between socioeconomic factors and health outcomes can be proven at both the individual and geographic level. In this study, we follow the second stream of literature. The objective of the study is to measure how deprivation changes over time in an urban context, finding out whether socioeconomic inequalities association with health outcomes endure over time. To do so, a census-based deprivation index (GDI—Genoa Deprivation Index) have been developed using three aggregation methods—additive, Mazziotta–Pareto, and Pena distance. The innovation of the work is the attempt to evaluate deprivation over time, trying to formalize a methodological path replicable in other situation. Health status has been assessed using the standardized (premature) mortality ratios. The findings reveal that although deprivation inequalities continue to exist in Genoa, global levels have been decreasing. In addition, the rate of premature mortality has shown improvements. Despite this, GDI scores continue to be associated with premature deaths: individuals living in deprived areas report consistently high standardised mortality ratios.},

Despite this, the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency's (DVLA) database of car model registrations remains underexplored as an indicator of socio-economic characteristics. In the past, car ownership itself has been frequently considered as a census proxy variable for affluence. However, this is an increasingly dated interpretation as ownership has become more widespread across society and the value of cars varies considerably. Understanding the geography of different car types, however, is likely to be more informative of local population characteristics as the choice of model is dependent on several factors, notably including the cost and the purpose of the vehicle. In partnership with the Department for Transport (DfT), a car segmentation was produced that grouped every car model registered in England and Wales in 2011 into 10 distinctive categories based on the vehicle's key characteristics. Data representing the total number of registered cars for each car segment and three age groups were made available at a small area geography (known as lower layer super output areas – LSOAs) to be analysed for this study. It revealed that each car segment is uniquely distributed across London, and the rest of England and Wales. The patterns were then compared with key 2011 Census variables on socio-economics to understand the extent to which spatial patterns of broad car characteristics correspond with variances in indicators of social make-up.},

Measures of population mixing were calculated for all municipalities for the 5-year period preceding the 1990 and 2000 censuses. Analyses were based on 2,128,012 children of whom 536 developed CL. HRs comparing highest with lowest quintile of population growth were 1.11 [95 \% confidence interval (CI) 0.65-1.89] in rural and 0.59 (95 \% CI 0.43-0.81) in urban municipalities (interaction: p = 0.271). Results were similar for ALL and for CL at age {$<$}5 years. For level of in-migration there was evidence of a negative association with ALL. HRs comparing highest with lowest quintile were 0.60 (95 \% CI 0.41-0.87) in urban and 0.61 (95 \% CI 0.30-1.21) in rural settings. There was little evidence of an association with diversity of origin. This nationwide cohort study of the association between CL and population growth, in-migration and diversity of origin provides little support for the population mixing hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Background Assessing exposure to infections in early childhood is of interest in many epidemiological investigations. Because exposure to infections is difficult to measure directly, epidemiological studies have used surrogate measures available from routine data such as birth order and population density. However, the association between population density and exposure to infections is unclear. We assessed whether neighbourhood child population density is associated with respiratory infections in infants. Methods With the Basel-Bern lung infant development study (BILD), a prospective Swiss cohort study of healthy neonates, respiratory symptoms and infections were assessed by weekly telephone interviews with the mother throughout the first year of life. Using population census data, we calculated neighbourhood child density as the number of children {$<$} 16 years of age living within a 250 m radius around the residence of each child. We used negative binomial regression models to assess associations between neighbourhood child density and the number of weeks with respiratory infections and adjusted for potential confounders including the number of older siblings, day-care attendance and duration of breastfeeding. We investigated possible interactions between neighbourhood child population density and older siblings assuming that older siblings mix with other children in the neighbourhood. Results The analyses included 487 infants. We found no evidence of an association between quintiles of neighbourhood child density and number of respiratory symptoms (p = 0.59, incidence rate ratios comparing highest to lowest quintile: 1.15, 95\%-confidence interval: 0.90–1.47). There was no evidence of interaction with older siblings (p = 0.44). Results were similar in crude and in fully adjusted models. Conclusions Our study suggests that in Switzerland neighbourhood child density is a poor proxy for exposure to infections in infancy.},

Based on previous research and theory, the Canadian Marginalization Index (CAN-Marg) was created to reflect four dimensions of marginalization: residential instability, material deprivation, dependency and ethnic concentration. The objective of this paper was threefold: to describe CAN-Marg; to illustrate its stability across geographic area and time; and to describe its association with health and behavioural problems. METHODS: CAN-Marg was created at the dissemination area (DA) and census tract level for census years 2001 and 2006, using factor analysis. Descriptions of 18 health and behavioural problems were selected using individual-level data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 3.1 and 2007/08. CAN-Marg quintiles created at the DA level (2006) were assigned to individual CCHS records. Multilevel logistic regression modeling was conducted to examine associations between marginalization and CCHS health and behavioural problems. RESULTS: The index demonstrated marked stability across time and geographic area. Each of the four dimensions showed strong and significant associations with the selected health and behavioural problems, and these associations differed depending on which of the dimensions of marginalization was examined. CONCLUSION: CAN-Marg is a census-based, empirically derived and theoretically informed tool designed to reflect a broader conceptualization of Canadian marginalization.},

  abstract = {Aims: To describe the development of a deprivation index for Danish parishes and to investigate its association with all-cause mortality compared with the Townsend index and individual-level factors. Methods: Nine socioeconomic factors were aggregated to the parish level from individual-level register data comprising the entire Danish population in 2005. A principal component analysis was conducted to reduce the number of factors and to apply weights. An ecological analysis investigated the association between the Danish Deprivation Index (DANDEX) and standardised mortality ratios in Danish parishes. Results were compared with the Townsend index and a possible modifying effect of population density was investigated. Sensitivity of the index was investigated with multilevel survival analyses evaluating the association between all-cause mortality and DANDEX, the Townsend Index, individual-level socioeconomic factors, and population density. Results: DANDEX consists of two components measuring socioeconomic properties of all 2119 Danish parishes. The first component measures deprivation related to housing (house and car ownership) while the second component is related to classical measures of socioeconomic status (education, income, occupation). A clear gradient in standardised mortality ratios was seen across quintiles of both index components. Modifying effects were seen when stratifying the index components by population density. In a frailty model, DANDEX accounted for 76\% of the between-parish variation in all-cause mortality, while the Townsend index and individual socioeconomic factors accounted for 71 and 76\%, respectively. Conclusions: The index can be used to identify Danish parishes by their levels of deprivation and it provides municipalities with a tool to allocate resources to the geographic areas where they are most needed.},

Results so far appear ambiguous and the objective of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review of previous studies and to quantify the association between area-level socioeconomic status (ALSES) and all-cause mortality in a meta-analysis. Current guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses were followed. Articles were retrieved from Medline, Embase, Social Sciences Citation Index and PsycInfo and individually evaluated by two researchers. Only peer-reviewed multilevel studies from high-income countries, which analyzed the influence of at least one area-level indicator and which controlled for individual SES, were included. The ALSES estimates in each study were first combined into a single estimate using weighted linear regression. In the meta-analysis we calculated combined estimates with random effects to account for heterogeneity between studies. Out of the 40 studies found eligible for the systematic review 18 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The systematic review suggests that there is an association between social cohesion and mortality but found no evidence for a clear association for area-level income inequality or for social capital. Studies including more than one area level suggest that characteristics on different area levels contribute to individual mortality. In the meta-analysis we found significantly higher mortality among inhabitants living in areas with low ALSES. Associations were stronger for men and younger age groups and in studies analyzing geographical units with fewer inhabitants.},

  abstract = {Background Switzerland had the highest life expectancy at 82.8 years among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in 2011. Geographical variation of life expectancy and its relation to the socioeconomic position of neighbourhoods are, however, not well understood. Methods We analysed the Swiss National Cohort, which linked the 2000 census with mortality records 2000–2008 to estimate life expectancy across neighbourhoods. A neighbourhood index of socioeconomic position (SEP) based on the median rent, education and occupation of household heads and crowding was calculated for 1.3 million overlapping neighbourhoods of 50 households. We used skew-normal regression models, including the index and additionally marital status, education, nationality, religion and occupation to calculate crude and adjusted estimates of life expectancy at age 30 years. Results Based on over 4.5 million individuals and over 400 000 deaths, estimates of life expectancy at age 30 in neighbourhoods ranged from 46.9 to 54.2 years in men and from 53.5 to 57.2 years in women. The correlation between life expectancy and neighbourhood SEP was strong (r=0.95 in men and r=0.94 women, both p values {$<$}0.0001). In a comparison of the lowest with the highest percentile of neighbourhood SEP, the crude difference in life expectancy from skew-normal regression was 4.5 years in men and 2.5 years in women. The corresponding adjusted differences were 2.8 and 1.9 years, respectively (all p values {$<$}0.0001). Conclusions Although life expectancy is high in Switzerland, there is substantial geographical variation and life expectancy is strongly associated with the social standing of neighbourhoods.},

LuftiBus in the school (LUIS) was set up to assess the respiratory health of schoolchildren in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland. LUIS is a cross-sectional population-based study that was carried out 2013 to 2016. Children aged 6-17 years living in the canton of Zurich were eligible to participate. All schools in the canton were approached and the school head decided whether the school would participate and with which classes. Consenting parents answered a standardized questionnaire at home and assenting children completed a shorter questionnaire by interview at school. Trained technicians measured children9s lung function including spirometry, double tracer gas single-breath washout (DTG-SBW) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). Address histories of participants were geocoded to be linked with area-based socioeconomic measures and environmental exposures like spatiotemporal air pollution estimates for specific time periods and locations. A subgroup was seen again 12 months later using the same procedures to collect longitudinal data. The study included 3870 children at baseline and 655 at the one-year follow-up. Median age was 12.7 years; 281 (8\%) had wheezed in the past year. At baseline we collected 3457 (89\%) parental and 3546 (92\%) children9s questionnaires, and 3393 (88\%) FeNO, 3446 (89\%) spirometry, and 1795 (46\%) DTG-SBW measurements.

In 13-17-year-olds, we studied risk factors for smoking and compared the frequency of respiratory problems between those who smoked and those who did not. Methods: We used data from LuftiBus in the school, a school-based survey of the respiratory health of children carried out 2013-2016 in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland. Participants were asked about cigarette, shisha, and electronic smoking device (ESD) smoking, and respiratory symptoms and diseases. We studied the association between smoking and risk factors using logistic regression. Results: We included 3488 schoolchildren with data on active smoking. Five percent of the 6-12-year-olds (90 of 1905) had smoked occasionally (\&lt;once/week). Among 13-17-year-olds (N=1583), 563 (36\%) had smoked occasionally of whom 414 smoked ESDs, 409 shishas, and 276 cigarettes. Among 54 (3\%) 13-17-year-olds who smoked frequently (≥once/week), 41 (76\%) smoked cigarettes, and 22\% of 15-17-year-olds (104/477) had smoked all three products. Smoking was more common in adolescents who were male, lived in rural areas, and whose mother (adjusted OR 1.7, 95\% CI 1.3-2.3) or father (aOR 1.5, 95\% CI 1.2-1.9) smoked. Respiratory symptoms in the past year such as rhinitis, dyspnoea, and wheeze were more common in adolescents who smoked frequently or occasionally than in never smokers. Conclusion: Smoking of shishas and ESDs is popular among Swiss adolescents and often combined with smoking cigarettes. Structural smoking prevention strategies should include all forms of smoking including shishas and ESDs.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This study uses innovative computer vision methods and a new big data source of street view images to automatically characterise neighbourhood built environments. Methods A total of 430 000 images were obtained using Google's Street View Image API for Salt Lake City, Chicago and Charleston. Convolutional neural networks were used to create indicators of street greenness, crosswalks and building type. We implemented log Poisson regression models to estimate associations between built environment features and individual prevalence of obesity and diabetes in Salt Lake City, controlling for individual-level and zip code-level predisposing characteristics. results Computer vision models had an accuracy of 86\%–93\% compared with manual annotations. Charleston had the highest percentage of green streets (79\%), while Chicago had the highest percentage of crosswalks (23\%) and commercial buildings/apartments (59\%). Built environment characteristics were categorised into tertiles, with the highest tertile serving as the referent group. Individuals living in zip codes with the most green streets, crosswalks and commercial buildings/apartments had relative obesity prevalences that were 25\%–28\% lower and relative diabetes prevalences that were 12\%–18\% lower than individuals living in zip codes with the least abundance of these neighbourhood features.

The development of the Indices of Deprivation 2000 for England and comparable indices for Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, involved a fundamental reappraisal and reconceptualisation of small-area level multiple deprivation and its measurement. Multiple deprivation is articulated as an accumulation of discrete dimensions or ‘domains’ of deprivation. This paper presents the key principles that were taken into consideration when constructing these four indices and the more recent English Indices of Deprivation 2004, and provides an account of the statistical techniques that were used to operationalise them.},

  abstract = {Social reformer Charles Booth undertook a massive survey into the social and economic conditions of the people of London at the end of the 19th century. An important innovation of his Inquiry was the construction of large, detailed maps displaying social class of inner London on a street-by-street basis. These provide a detailed and vivid picture of the geography of poverty and affluence at this time. These maps have been digitised, georeferenced and linked to contemporary ward boundaries allowing Booth's measurement of social class to be matched to the measurement of social class in the 1991 census of population and standardised mortality ratios derived for all causes of death in the survey area between 1991 and 1995. The social class data were used to derive an index of relative poverty for both time periods and a comparison of the geographies of relative poverty and their relationship with contemporary mortality was made. Although the overall standard of living had increased, the geography of poverty at the end of the 19th century was very similar to that at the end of the 20th century. Moreover, the geography of all causes of death for people over the age of 65 was more strongly related to the geography of poverty in the late 19th century than contemporary patterns of poverty. This relationship was also true for mortality for specific diseases that are related to deprivation in early life. The paper concludes that the spatial patterns of poverty in inner London are extremely robust and a century of change has failed to disrupt it. Copyright © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Height is linked to various health outcomes such as morbidity and mortality and has consequences on the societal level. The aim of this study was to describe small-area variation of height and associated factors among young men in Switzerland. Data from 175,916 conscripts (aged between 18.50 and 20.50 years) was collected between 2005 and 2011, which represented approximately 90\% of the corresponding birth cohorts. These were analysed using Gaussian hierarchical models in a Bayesian framework to investigate the spatial pattern of mean height across postcodes. The models varied both in random effects and degree of adjustment (professional status, area-based socioeconomic position, and language region). We found a strong spatial structure for mean height across postcodes. The range of height differences between mean postcode level estimates was 3.40cm according to the best fitting model, with the shorter conscripts coming from the Italian and French speaking parts of Switzerland. There were positive socioeconomic gradients in height at both individual and area-based levels. Spatial patterns for height persisted after adjustment for individual factors, but not when language region was included. Socio-economic position and cultural/natural boundaries such as language borders and mountain passes are shaping patterns of height for Swiss conscripts. Small area mapping of height contributes to the understanding of its cofactors.},

  abstract = {Living in high-rise buildings could influence the health of residents. Previous studies focused on structural features of high-rise buildings or characteristics of their neighbourhoods, ignoring differences within buildings in socio-economic position or health outcomes. We examined mortality by floor of residence in the Swiss National Cohort, a longitudinal study based on the linkage of December 2000 census with mortality and emigration records 2001–2008. Analyses were based on 1.5 million people living in buildings with four or more floors and 142,390 deaths recorded during 11.4 million person-years of follow-up. Cox models were adjusted for age, sex, civil status, nationality, language, religion, education, professional status, type of household and crowding. The rent per m2 increased with higher floors and the number of persons per room decreased. Mortality rates decreased with increasing floors: hazard ratios comparing the ground floor with the eighth floor and above were 1.22 [95~\% confidence interval (CI) 1.15–1.28] for all causes, 1.40 (95~\% CI 1.11–1.77) for respiratory diseases, 1.35 (95~\% CI 1.22–1.49) for cardiovascular diseases and 1.22 (95~\% CI 0.99–1.50) for lung cancer, but 0.41 (95~\% CI 0.17–0.98) for suicide by jumping from a high place. There was no association with suicide by any means (hazard ratio 0.81; 95~\% CI 0.57–1.15). We conclude that in Switzerland all-cause and cause-specific mortality varies across floors of residence among people living in high-rise buildings. Gradients in mortality suggest that floor of residence captures residual socioeconomic stratification and is likely to be mediated by behavioural (e.g. physical activity), and environmental exposures, and access to a method of suicide.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Area-based measures of socioeconomic position (SEP) suitable for epidemiological research are lacking in Switzerland. The authors developed the Swiss neighbourhood index of SEP (Swiss-SEP). METHODS: Neighbourhoods of 50 households with overlapping boundaries were defined using Census 2000 and road network data. Median rent per square metre, proportion households headed by a person with primary education or less, proportion headed by a person in manual or unskilled occupation and the mean number of persons per room were analysed in principle component analysis. The authors compared the index with independent income data and examined associations with mortality from 2001 to 2008. RESULTS: 1.27 million overlapping neighbourhoods were defined. Education, occupation and housing variables had loadings of 0.578, 0.570 and 0.362, respectively, and median rent had a loading of -0.459. Mean yearly equivalised income of households increased from SFr42 000 to SFr72 000 between deciles of neighbourhoods with lowest and highest SEP. Comparing deciles of neighbourhoods with lowest to highest SEP, the age- and sex-adjusted HR was 1.38 (95\% CI 1.36 to 1.41) for all-cause mortality, 1.83 (95\% CI 1.71 to 1.95) for lung cancer, 1.48 (95\% CI 1.44 to 1.51) for cardiovascular diseases, 2.42 (95\% CI 1.94 to 3.01) for traffic accidents, 0.93 (95\% CI 0.85 to 1.02) for breast cancer and 0.86 (95\% CI 0.78 to 0.95) for suicide. CONCLUSIONS: Developed using a novel approach to define neighbourhoods, the Swiss-SEP index was strongly associated with household income and some causes of death. It will be useful for clinical- and population-based studies, where individual-level socioeconomic data are often missing, and to investigate the effects on health of the socioeconomic characteristics of a place.},

Little is known about variation of cost of end of life care between regions and the drivers of such variation. We studied small-area patterns of cost of care in the last year of life in Switzerland.         Methods:~         We used mandatory health insurance claims data of individuals who died between 2008 and 2010 to derive cost of care. We used multilevel regression models to estimate differences in costs across 564 regions of place of residence, nested within 71 hospital service areas. We examined to what extent variation was explained by characteristics of individuals and regions, including measures of health care supply.         Results:~         The study population consisted of 113,277 individuals. The mean cost of care during last year of life was 32.5k (thousand) Swiss Francs per person (SD=33.2k). Cost differed substantially between regions after adjustment for patient age, sex, and cause of death. Variance was reduced by 52\%–95\% when we added individual and regional characteristics, with a strong effect of language region. Measures of supply of care did not show associations with costs. Remaining between and within hospital service area variations were most pronounced for older females and least for younger individuals.         Conclusions:~         In Switzerland, small-area analysis revealed variation of cost of care during the last year of life according to linguistic regions and unexplained regional differences for older women. Cultural factors contribute to the delivery and utilization of health care during the last months of life and should be considered by policy makers.},

Methods The study identified homicide–suicide events 1991–2008 in persons from the same household in the Swiss National Cohort, which links census and mortality records. The analysis examined the association of the risk of dying in a homicide–suicide event with socio-demographic variables, measured at the individual-level, household composition variables and area-level variables. Proportional hazards regression models were calculated for male perpetrators and female victims. Results are presented as age-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CI). Results The study identified 158 deaths from homicide–suicide events, including 85 murder victims (62 women, 4 men, 19 children and adolescents) and 68 male and 5 female perpetrators. The incidence was 3 events per million households and year. Firearms were the most prominent method for both homicides and suicides. The risk of perpetrating homicide-suicide was higher in divorced than in married men (HR 3.64; 95\%CI 1.56–8.49), in foreigners without permanent residency compared to Swiss citizens (HR 3.95; 1.52–10.2), higher in men without religious affiliations than in Catholics (HR 2.23; 1.14–4.36) and higher in crowded households (HR 4.85; 1.72–13.6 comparing ≥2 with {$<$}1 persons/room). There was no association with education, occupation or nationality, the number of children, the language region or degree of urbanicity. Associations were similar for female victims. Conclusions This national longitudinal study shows that living conditions associated with psychological stress and lower levels of social support are associated with homicide-suicide events in Switzerland.},

The purpose of this study is to elucidate their prevalence and trends in Switzerland by analyzing variations in Body Mass Index (BMI) of Swiss conscripts. Methods The conscription records were provided by the Swiss Army. This study focussed on conscripts 18.5–20.5 years of age from the seven one-year birth cohorts spanning the period 1986–1992. BMI across professional status, area-based socioeconomic position (abSEP), urbanicity and regions was analyzed. Two piecewise quantile regression models with linear splines for three birth-cohort groups were used to examine the association of median BMI with explanatory variables and to determine the extent to which BMI has varied over time. Results The study population consisted of 188,537 individuals. Median BMI was 22.51 kg/m2 (22.45–22.57 95\% confidence interval (CI)). BMI was lower among conscripts of high professional status (−0.46 kg/m2; 95\% CI: −0.50, −0.42, compared with low), living in areas of high abSEP (−0.11 kg/m2; 95\% CI: −0.16, −0.07 compared to medium) and from urban communities (−0.07 kg/m2; 95\% CI: −0.11, −0.03, compared with peri-urban). Comparing with Midland, median BMI was highest in the North-West (0.25 kg/m2; 95\% CI: 0.19–0.30) and Central regions (0.11 kg/m2; 95\% CI: 0.05–0.16) and lowest in the East (−0.19 kg/m2; 95\% CI: −0.24, −0.14) and Lake Geneva regions (−0.15 kg/m2; 95\% CI: −0.20, −0.09). Trajectories of regional BMI growth varied across birth cohorts, with median BMI remaining high in the Central and North-West regions, whereas stabilization and in some cases a decline were observed elsewhere. Conclusions BMI of Swiss conscripts is associated with individual and abSEP and urbanicity. Results show regional variation in the levels and temporal trajectories of BMI growth and signal their possible slowdown among recent birth cohorts.},

  abstract = {Objective The study was designed to explore the development of the general practitioner (GP) shortage in primary care and its characteristics in Hungary. Design Longitudinal follow-up study over the decade 2007–2016. Methods Analyses were performed on changes in number, age and sex of GPs by practice type (adult, paediatric and mixed), as well as on their geographical distribution and migration between areas characterised by deprivation index (DI) at municipality level. The association between deprivation and vacancy for GPs was studied by risk analysis. The number of population underserved was defined by DI quintile. Setting and subjects The study involved all general practices and GPs in the period examined. Main outcome measure It is showed that the number of general practices with unfilled GP posts was increasing exponentially, mainly in the most deprived areas of the country. Results A decrease in the number of GPs in all types of practices, especially in mixed (by 7.7\%; p{$<$}0.001) and paediatric (by 6.5\%; p{$<$}0.001) ones, was shown; the number of adult practices with unfilled GP posts doubled, while the number of paediatric practices with a vacancy for a paediatrician more than tripled. The average age of GPs was increased by 3.7 years (p{$<$}0.001) in adult, by 5.4 years (p{$<$}0.001) in paediatric and by 4.2 years (p{$<$}0.001) in mixed practices. In 2007, 52.27\% (95\% CI 51.03 to 53.5) of the GPs were women, and this rate increased to 56.19\% (95\% CI 54.93 to 57.44) by the end of the decade. An exponential association between relative vacancy rate and deprivation was confirmed. As a result of the migration of GPs, in the most deprived areas, the number of GPs decreased by 8.43\% (95\% CI 5.86 to 10.99). Conclusions The workforce crisis in Hungarian primary care is progressively deepening and resulting in more severe inequity in access to healthcare.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT OBJECTIVES: To develop a deprivation index to study health inequalities in 221 areas of Ecuador, to describe the pattern of deprivation in Ecuador, and to explore the applications of the index to study health inequalities by analysing the association between deprivation and mortality in the study areas. METHODS: We performed principal component analyses of available indicators of the 221 cantons of Ecuador. A set of 41 sociodemographic, social capital, and subjective well-being variables were obtained from the 2010 National Population Census and the National Living Conditions Survey 2013–2014. To explore the application of the index in public health, the association between the index and standardised mortality ratios was estimated through a Poisson regression model. RESULTS: The final index was constructed with 17 indicators. The first component explained 51.8\% of the total variance of the data. A geographic pattern and a positive association of the index with the standardised mortality ratios of the cantons were observed in both men and women. CONCLUSIONS: We constructed a deprivation index that can identify disadvantaged areas in Ecuador. This index could be a valuable tool for the detection of vulnerabilised populations and the development of interventions and policies adapted to local needs.},

  abstract = {Despite increasing recognition in economically developed countries of the importance of addressing health inequalities, there has been a nearly universal failure to consider equality issues in both academic reviews of approaches to suicide prevention and the formulation of national suicide prevention strategies. This has occurred despite ample evidence of systematic inequalities in the risk of suicidal behaviour associated with different indicators of social position, including labour market status, occupational social class, education, income, housing tenure and labour market position, at the individual level, and socioeconomic deprivation, at the aggregate level. This chapter reviews the relevant worldwide literature and describes an investigation of deaths due to intentional self-harm and undetermined causes in Scotland over the period 1989-2002. The weight of evidence summarised in the review points to the existence of socioeconomic inequalities in suicidal behaviour across a range of indicators at both individual and area levels. The findings of the empirical study confirm that low social class and socioeconomic deprivation are associated with increased suicide risk; and suggest that the influence of individual social class is far stronger than the influence of area-level socioeconomic affluence/deprivation in accounting for suicide-related inequality. An exceptionally high relative risk of suicide was found among those in the lowest social class living in the most deprived areas (approximately 10 times higher than the risk of suicide among those in the highest social class in the most affluent areas). The cumulative research evidence highlights the importance of applying an equity lens to national suicide prevention strategies and action plans. Many policy challenges require resolution, however, including the strategic approach to inequality reduction, whether people or places are to be targeted, and the identification of interventions that are likely to be effective in reducing socioeconomic inequalities in suicide risk.},

Existing studies that explore the local patterning of disadvantage often construct composite indices that summarize the interactions between multiple dimensions of social status, but do not consider if, and how, disadvantage exhibits spatial structure. This study applies a Bayesian multivariate factor analytic modeling approach to examine the spatial structure of socioeconomic disadvantage in Toronto, Canada. Socioeconomic disadvantage is modeled as an area-based composite index associated with three variables measuring low income, low-educational attainment, and low occupational status, and a series of models with different assumptions regarding the spatial structure of disadvantage are compared. The best-fitting model shows that the prevalence of low-income households has the strongest positive association with disadvantage and that spatial clustering is three times more important than spatial heterogeneity for explaining the spatial structure of disadvantage. The implications of this study for analyzing multivariate spatial data and for understanding the interactions amongst multiple dimensions of disadvantage are discussed.},

  abstract = {Socioeconomic inequalities are major health determinants. To monitor and understand them at local level, ecological indexes of socioeconomic deprivation constitute essential tools. In this study, we describe the development of the updated version of the European Deprivation Index for Portuguese small-areas (EDI-PT), describe its spatial distribution and evaluate its association with a general health indicator–all-cause mortality in the period 2009–2012. Using data from the 2011 European Union–Statistics on Income and Living Conditions Survey (EU-SILC), we obtained an indicator of individual deprivation. After identifying variables that were common to both the EU-SILC and the census, we used the indicator of individual deprivation to test if these variables were associated with individual-level deprivation, and to compute weights. Accordingly, eight variables were included. The EDI-PT was produced for the smallest area unit possible (n = 18084 census block groups, mean/area = 584 inhabitants) and resulted from the weighted sum of the eight selected variables. It was then categorized into quintiles (Q1-least deprived to Q5-most deprived). To estimate the association with mortality we fitted Bayesian spatial models. The EDI-PT was unevenly distributed across Portugal–most deprived areas concentrated in the South and in the inner North and Centre of the country, and the least deprived in the coastal North and Centre. The EDI-PT was positively and significantly associated with overall mortality, and this relation followed a rather clear dose-response relation of increasing mortality as deprivation increases (Relative Risk Q2 = 1.012, 95\% Credible Interval 0.991–1.033; Q3 = 1.026, 1.004–1.048; Q4 = 1.053, 1.029–1.077; Q5 = 1.068, 1.042–1.095). Summing up, we updated the index of socioeconomic deprivation for Portuguese small-areas, and we showed that the EDI-PT constitutes a sensitive measure to capture health inequalities, since it was consistently associated with a key measure of population health/development, all-cause mortality. We strongly believe this updated version will be widely employed by social and medical researchers and regional planners.},

  abstract = {Socioeconomic deprivation accounts for much of the spatial inequality in health in the UK, but a significant proportion remains unexplained. It is highly likely that the physical environment is a key factor in this unexplained variation. The role of the socioeconomic environment in health inequalities has been studied using small-area measures of multiple socioeconomic deprivation that capture the burden of socioeconomic adversity. Although similar composite measures of the physical environment would greatly assist investigations of environmental determinants of health no such measures are available. In this study we developed two small-area measures of health-related multiple physical environmental deprivation for the UK. A thorough review and evidence appraisal process was used to identify health-relevant dimensions of physical environmental deprivation. As a result we selected both health-detrimental (air pollution, cold climate, industrial facilities) and health-beneficial (ultraviolet radiation and green space) dimensions. Datasets describing each of the selected dimensions were acquired, and rendered to UK Census Area Statistics wards (n = 10 654, average population = 5518). We developed two summary measures: the multiple environmental deprivation index (MEDIx) and classification (MEDClass). MEDIx, on an ordinal scale, can be used to distinguish areas exposed to greater or lesser environmental deprivation. MEDClass groups areas with similar environmental characteristics and will be useful for exploring health effects of specific types of environment. Mapping these measures demonstrated a wide variation in physical environmental deprivation across the UK. MEDIx revealed greater environmental deprivation in urban and industrial areas, and at more northerly latitudes. Although created using a different methodology MEDClass also differentiated these environmental types. We concluded that it is possible to capture and characterise multiple attributes of health-related physical environmental deprivation in the UK, at a small area level. The measures we developed offer opportunities to researchers and policy makers for developing our understanding of the role of exposure to multiple dimensions of physical environmental deprivation on health outcomes.},

  abstract = {Objective Understanding the factors that influence human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination uptake is critically important to the design of effective vaccination programmes. In Switzerland, HPV vaccination uptake (≥1 dose) by age 16 years among women ranges from 31\% to 80\% across 26 cantons (states). Our objective was to identify factors that are associated with the spatial variation in HPV vaccination uptake. Methods We used cross-sectional data from the Swiss National Vaccination Coverage Survey 2009–2016 on HPV vaccination status (≥1 dose) of 14–17-year-old girls, their municipality of residence and their nationality for 21 of 26 cantons (n=8965). We examined covariates at municipality level: language, degree of urbanisation, socioeconomic position, religious denomination, results of a vote about vaccination laws as a proxy for vaccine scepticism and, at cantonal level, availability of school-based vaccination and survey period. We used a series of conditional autoregressive models to assess the effects of covariates while accounting for variability between cantons and municipal-level spatial autocorrelation. Results In the best-fit model, living in cantons that have school-based vaccination (adjusted OR 2.51; 95\% credible interval 1.77 to 3.56) was associated with increased uptake, while living in municipalities with lower acceptance of vaccination laws was associated with lower HPV vaccination uptake (OR 0.61; 95\% credible interval 0.50 to 0.73). Overall, the covariates explained 88\% of the municipal-level variation in uptake. Conclusions In Switzerland, both cantons and community opinion about vaccination play a prominent role in the variation in HPV vaccination uptake. To increase uptake, efforts should be made to mitigate vaccination scepticism and to encourage school-based vaccination.},

  abstract = {The term deprivation is often used to refer to economic or social shortages in a given geographical area. This concept of deprivation has been identified for years using simple indicators such as income level, education and social class. One of the advantages of using simple indicators is the availability of data, since they come directly from sources of information like censuses and population registers. However, the main disadvantage of these indicators is their limited usefulness when measuring a concept as complex as deprivation with a single variable. One possible solution to this problem is using compound indices, made up of a combination of simple indicators. For years, the concept of material deprivation in Spain has been measured using indices or indicators imported from other countries. However, there are no studies that investigate if all of these variables are really related to material deprivation in Spain. In this context, the objective of this study is to create a synthetic index for material deprivation for the municipalities in Spain, bearing in mind the variables available from the Population and Housing Census. The index was built on a principal components factor analysis. The analysis showed two factors. The first factor showed a high positive correlation to the variables relating to illiteracy rate, unemployment rate and percentage of manual labourers, while the second factor was seen as highly positively correlated to the variables relating to the percentage of homes without access to a vehicle and the dependency index and also correlated, though negatively, to the percentage of foreigners between 16 and 49 who lived abroad in 1991. The variables that make up the first factor can be considered to be an approximation of the concept of deprivation in Spain. This study proposes a deprivation index made up of three simple indicators available from national information sources: percentage of illiteracy, percentage of unemployment and percentage of manual labourers. With this index, the criteria for measuring deprivation in Spanish municipalities can be unified and a comparison of the results of the different studies in our context facilitated.},

The index is estimated for 17 countries of the region at two points in time—one around 2005 and the other around 2012. Overall, we estimate about 28 percent of people are multidimensionally poor in 2012 in the region. We find statistically significant reductions of poverty in most countries, both in terms of incidence and intensity over the period under analysis. However, important disparities between rural and urban areas remain. Statistical scrutiny of the index suggests that it captures the state of poverty relatively well while maintaining a certain parsimony and being highly robust to changes in weights, indicators, and poverty cut-off.},

  abstract = {The advent of publishing anonymized call detail records opens the door for temporal and spatial human dynamics studies. Such studies, besides being useful for creating universal models for mobility patterns, could be also used for creating new socio-economic proxy indicators that will not rely only on the local or state institutions. In this paper, from the frequency of calls at different times of the day, in different small regional units (sub-prefectures) in Côte d'Ivoire, we infer users' home and work sub-prefectures. This division of users enables us to analyze different mobility and calling patterns for the different regions. We then compare how those patterns correlate to the data from other sources, such as: news for particular events in the given period, census data, economic activity, poverty index, power plants and energy grid data. Our results show high correlation in many of the cases revealing the diversity of socio-economic insights that can be inferred using only mobile phone call data. The methods and the results may be particularly relevant to policy-makers engaged in poverty reduction initiatives as they can provide an affordable tool in the context of resource-constrained developing economies, such as Côte d'Ivoire's.},

  abstract = {Background Percutaneous vertebroplasty (VP) and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) for treating painful osteoporotic vertebral fractures are controversial. Objective We assessed the regional variation in the use of VP/BKP in Switzerland. Methods We conducted a population-based small area variation analysis using patient discharge data for VP/BKP from all Swiss hospitals and Swiss census data for calendar years 2012/13. We derived hospital service areas (HSAs) by analyzing patient flows, assigning regions from which most residents were discharged to the same VP/BKP specific HSA. We calculated age-/sex-standardized mean VP/BKP-rates and measures of regional variation (extremal quotient [EQ], systematic component of variation [SCV]). We estimated the reduction in variation of VP/BKP rates using negative binomial regression, with adjustment for patient demographic and regional socioeconomic factors (socioeconomic status, urbanization, and language region). We considered the residual, unexplained variation most likely to be unwarranted. Results Overall, 4955 VP/BKPs were performed in Switzerland in 2012/13. The age-/sex-standardized mean VP/BKP rate was 4.6/10,000 persons and ranged from 1.0 to 10.1 across 26 HSAs. The EQ was 10.2 and the SCV 57.6, indicating a large variation across VP/BKP specific HSAs. After adjustment for demographic and socioeconomic factors, the total reduction in variance was 32.2\% only, with the larger part of the variation remaining unexplained. Conclusions We found a 10-fold variation in VP/BKP rates across Swiss VP/BKP specific HSAs. As only one third of the variation was explained by differences in patient demographics and regional socioeconomic factors, VP/BKP in the highest-use areas may, at least partially, represent overtreatment.},

  abstract = {Background Gestational age and birth weight are strong predictors of infant morbidity and mortality. Understanding spatial variation can inform policies to reduce health inequalities. We examined small-area variation in gestational age and birth weight in Switzerland. Methods All singleton live births recorded in the Swiss Live Birth Register 2011 to 2014 were eligible. We deterministically linked the Live Birth Register with census and survey data to create data sets including neonatal and pregnancy-related variables, parental characteristics and geographical variables. We produced maps of 705 areas and fitted linear mixed-effect models to assess to what extent spatial variation was explained by these variables. Results We analysed all 315 177 eligible live births. Area-level averages of gestational age varied between 272 and 279 days, and between 3138 and 3467 g for birth weight. The fully adjusted models explained 31\% and 87\% of spatial variation of gestational age and birth weight, respectively. Language region accounted for most of the explained variation (23\% in gestational age and 62\% in birth weight), with shorter gestational age (−0.6 days and −0.9 days) and lower birth weight (−1.1\% and −1.8\%) in French-speaking and Italian-speaking areas, respectively, compared with German-speaking areas. Other variables explaining variation were, for gestational age, the level of urbanisation (10\%) and parental nationality (3\%). For birth weight, they were gestational age (27\%), parental nationality (27\%), civil status (10\%) and altitude (10\%). In a random sample of 81 968 live births with data on parental education, levels of education were only weakly associated with gestational age (−0.9 days for compulsory vs tertiary maternal education) or birth weight (−0.7\% for compulsory vs tertiary maternal education). Conclusions In Switzerland, small area variation in birth weight is largely explained, and variation in gestational age partially explained, by geocultural, sociodemographic and pregnancy factors.},

Design, setting and participants Longitudinal study of the adult Swiss population (n = 4 376 873) based on census records linked to mortality data from 2001 to 2008. Measurements Sex-specific hazard ratios (HR) for death and 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CI) were calculated using Cox models adjusting for age, educational level, occupational attainment, marital status and other potential confounders. The density of alcohol-selling outlets within 1000 m of the residence was calculated using geocodes of outlets and residences. Findings Compared with {$>$}17 outlets within 1000 m the HR for alcohol-related mortality in men was 0.95 (95\%CI: 0.89–1.02) for 8–17 outlets, 0.84 (95\%CI: 0.77–0.90) for 3–7 outlets, 0.76 (95\%CI: 0.68–0.83) for 1–2 outlets and 0.60 (95\%CI: 0.51–0.72) for 0 outlets. The gradient in women was somewhat steeper, with a HR comparing 0 with {$>$}17 outlets of 0.39 (95\%CI: 0.26–0.60). Mortality from mental and behavioural causes and lung cancer were also associated with density of alcohol-selling outlets: HRs comparing 0 outlets with {$>$}17 outlets were 0.64 (95\%CI: 0.52–0.79) and 0.79 (95\%CI: 0.72–0.88), respectively, in men and 0.46 (95\%CI: 0.27–0.78) and 0.63 (95\%CI: 0.52–0.77), respectively, in women. There were weak associations in the same direction with all-cause mortality in men but not in women. Conclusions In Switzerland, alcohol-related mortality is associated with the density of outlets around the place of residence. Community-level interventions to reduce alcohol outlet density may usefully complement existing interventions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to medium or high doses of ionizing radiation is a known risk factor for cancer in children. The extent to which low-dose radiation from natural sources contributes to the risk of childhood cancer remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: In a nationwide census-based cohort study, we investigated whether the incidence of childhood cancer was associated with background radiation from terrestrial gamma and cosmic rays. METHODS: Children {$<$} 16 years of age in the Swiss National Censuses in 1990 and 2000 were included. The follow-up period lasted until 2008, and incident cancer cases were identified from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. A radiation model was used to predict dose rates from terrestrial and cosmic radiation at locations of residence. Cox regression models were used to assess associations between cancer risk and dose rates and cumulative dose since birth. RESULTS: Among 2,093,660 children included at census, 1,782 incident cases of cancer were identified including 530 with leukemia, 328 with lymphoma, and 423 with a tumor of the central nervous system (CNS). Hazard ratios for each millisievert increase in cumulative dose of external radiation were 1.03 (95\% CI: 1.01, 1.05) for any cancer, 1.04 (95\% CI: 1.00, 1.08) for leukemia, 1.01 (95\% CI: 0.96, 1.05) for lymphoma, and 1.04 (95\% CI: 1.00, 1.08) for CNS tumors. Adjustment for a range of potential confounders had little effect on the results. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that background radiation may contribute to the risk of cancer in children, including leukemia and CNS tumors.},

Few studies have focused specifically on benzene. Objectives To examine whether parental occupational exposure to benzene is associated with an increased cancer risk in a census-based cohort of children. Methods From a census-based cohort study in Switzerland, we included children aged {$<$}16years at national censuses (1990, 2000). We retrieved parental occupations reported at census and assessed exposure to benzene using a job exposure matrix. We identified incident cancer cases through record linkage with the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. We fitted Cox proportional-hazards models to assess associations between exposures and the following outcomes: any cancer, leukaemia, acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, central nervous system (CNS) tumours, and glioma. We adjusted models for a range of socio-economic, perinatal and environmental factors. Results Analyses of maternal (paternal) exposure were based on 9.0 (13.2)millionperson years at risk and included 1004 (1520) cases of cancer, of which 285 (438) had leukaemia, 186 (281) lymphoma, 227 (339) a CNS tumour. Maternal exposure was associated with an increased risk of childhood leukaemia (hazard ratio 1.73, 95\% CI 1.12–2.67) and ALL (1.88, 1.16–3.04). We found little evidence of an association for other outcomes or for paternal exposure. Adjusting for potential confounders did not materially affect the results. Conclusions This nationwide cohort study suggests an increased risk of leukaemia among children whose mothers were exposed to benzene at work.},

  abstract = {Objective To determine whether the strong increase in assisted suicides in Switzerland since 2008 is linked to a shift in the socioeconomic factors associated with assisted suicide and its related diagnoses. Methods In a population-based longitudinal study, we investigated assisted suicides in Switzerland over the period 2003–2014. Two groups of younger (25–64 years) and older (65–94 years) persons were analysed separately and compared. We calculated crude rates and used Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression models to examine associations of assisted dying with gender, marital status, education, religion, neighbourhood socioeconomic status and other variables, and investigated trends over time. Results We identified 3941 assisted suicides among 6 237 997 Swiss residents, 80\% of which occurred in the older age group. Crude rates of assisted suicide more than tripled during the study period from 3.60 to 11.21 per 100 000 person-years; the increase was more pronounced in the older age group. Cancer was the most common underlying diagnosis (41.8\%), but the percentage dying assisted was highest among patients with diseases of the nervous system (5.25\% in the younger and 1.23\% in the older age group). The factors associated with assisted suicide did not change during the study period. Female gender, higher education, having no religious affiliation, no children and a Swiss passport, living in a neighbourhood with a higher socioeconomic index and living in the French-speaking part of Switzerland were associated with a higher rate. Conclusions The study results do not indicate any shift in socioeconomic factors associated with assisted suicide, but a more pronounced increase in incidence among the elderly.},

  abstract = {Suicide in adolescents is the second most common cause of death in this age group and an important public health problem. We examined sociodemographic factors associated with suicide in Swiss adolescents and analysed time trends in youth suicide in the Swiss National Cohort (SNC). The SNC is a longitudinal study of the whole Swiss resident population, based on linkage of census and mortality records. We identified suicides in adolescents aged 10–18~years from 1991 to 2013. A total of 2.396 million adolescents were included and 592 suicides were recorded, corresponding to a rate of 3.7 per 100,000 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 3.4–4.0]. Rates increased with age from 0.0 per 100,000 at age 10~years to 14.8 per 100,000 (95\% CI 12.6–17.5) at 18~years in boys, and from 0.0 to 5.4 per 100,000 (4.1–7.2) in girls. Being a boy, living in a single parent household, being an only or middle-born child, and living in rural regions were factors associated with a higher rate of suicide. Hanging was the most common method in boys, and railway suicides were most frequent in girls. There was no clear evidence for an increase or decrease over calendar time. We conclude that familial and socioeconomic factors including type of household, birth order and urbanity are associated with youth suicide in Switzerland. These factors should be considered when designing prevention programmes for youth suicide.},

  abstract = {Background: In Switzerland, assisted suicide is legal but there is concern that vulnerable or disadvantaged groups are more likely to die in this way than other people. We examined socio-economic factors associated with assisted suicide.Methods: We linked the suicides assisted by right-to-die associations during 2003–08 to a census-based longitudinal study of the Swiss population. We used Cox and logistic regression models to examine associations with gender, age, marital status, education, religion, type of household, urbanization, neighbourhood socio-economic position and other variables. Separate analyses were done for younger (25 to 64 years) and older (65 to 94 years) people.Results: Analyses were based on 5 004 403 Swiss residents and 1301 assisted suicides (439 in the younger and 862 in the older group). In 1093 (84.0\%) assisted suicides, an underlying cause was recorded; cancer was the most common cause (508, 46.5\%). In both age groups, assisted suicide was more likely in women than in men, those living alone compared with those living with others and in those with no religious affiliation compared with Protestants or Catholics. The rate was also higher in more educated people, in urban compared with rural areas and in neighbourhoods of higher socio-economic position. In older people, assisted suicide was more likely in the divorced compared with the married; in younger people, having children was associated with a lower rate.Conclusions: Assisted suicide in Switzerland was associated with female gender and situations that may indicate greater vulnerability such as living alone or being divorced, but also with higher education and higher socio-economic position.},

  abstract = {Background Hysterectomy is the last treatment option for benign uterine diseases, and vaginal hysterectomy is preferred over more invasive techniques. We assessed the regional variation in hysterectomy rates for benign uterine diseases across Switzerland and explored potential determinants of variation. Methods We conducted a population-based analysis using patient discharge data from all Swiss hospitals between 2013 and 2016. Hospital service areas (HSAs) for hysterectomies were derived by analyzing patient flows. We calculated age-standardized mean procedure rates and measures of regional variation (extremal quotient [EQ], highest divided by lowest rate) and systematic component of variation [SCV]). We estimated the reduction in the variance of crude hysterectomy rates across HSAs in multilevel regression models, with incremental adjustment for procedure year, age, cultural/socioeconomic factors, burden of disease, and density of gynecologists. Results Overall, 40,211 hysterectomies from 54 HSAs were analyzed. The mean age-standardized hysterectomy rate was 298/100,000 women (range 186–456). While the variation in overall procedure rate was moderate (EQ 2.5, SCV 3.7), we found a very high procedure-specific variation (EQ vaginal 5.0, laparoscopic 6.3, abdominal 8.0; SCV vaginal 17.5, laparoscopic 11.2, abdominal 16.9). Adjusted for procedure year, demographic, cultural, and sociodemographic factors, a large share (64\%) of the variance remained unexplained (vaginal 63\%, laparoscopic 85\%, abdominal 70\%). The main determinants of variation were socioeconomic/cultural factors. Burden of disease and the density of gynecologists was not associated with procedure rates. Conclusions Switzerland has a very high regional variation in vaginal, laparoscopic, and abdominal hysterectomy for benign uterine disease. After adjustment for potential determinants of variation including demographic factors, socioeconomic and cultural factors, burden of disease, and the density of gynecologists, two thirds of the variation remain unexplained.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Potentially avoidable risk factors continue to cause unnecessary disability and premature death in older people. Health risk assessment (HRA), a method successfully used in working-age populations, is a promising method for cost-effective health promotion and preventive care in older individuals, but the long-term effects of this approach are unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of an innovative approach to HRA and counselling in older individuals for health behaviours, preventive care, and long-term survival.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: This study was a pragmatic, single-centre randomised controlled clinical trial in community-dwelling individuals aged 65 y or older registered with one of 19 primary care physician (PCP) practices in a mixed rural and urban area in Switzerland. From November 2000 to January 2002, 874 participants were randomly allocated to the intervention and 1,410 to usual care. The intervention consisted of HRA based on self-administered questionnaires and individualised computer-generated feedback reports, combined with nurse and PCP counselling over a 2-y period. Primary outcomes were health behaviours and preventive care use at 2 y and all-cause mortality at 8 y. At baseline, participants in the intervention group had a mean ± standard deviation of 6.9 ± 3.7 risk factors (including unfavourable health behaviours, health and functional impairments, and social risk factors) and 4.3 ± 1.8 deficits in recommended preventive care. At 2 y, favourable health behaviours and use of preventive care were more frequent in the intervention than in the control group (based on z-statistics from generalised estimating equation models). For example, 70\% compared to 62\% were physically active (odds ratio 1.43, 95\% CI 1.16-1.77, p = 0.001), and 66\% compared to 59\% had influenza vaccinations in the past year (odds ratio 1.35, 95\% CI 1.09-1.66, p = 0.005). At 8 y, based on an intention-to-treat analysis, the estimated proportion alive was 77.9\% in the intervention and 72.8\% in the control group, for an absolute mortality difference of 4.9\% (95\% CI 1.3\%-8.5\%, p = 0.009; based on z-test for risk difference). The hazard ratio of death comparing intervention with control was 0.79 (95\% CI 0.66-0.94, p = 0.009; based on Wald test from Cox regression model), and the number needed to receive the intervention to prevent one death was 21 (95\% CI 12-79). The main limitations of the study include the single-site study design, the use of a brief self-administered questionnaire for 2-y outcome data collection, the unavailability of other long-term outcome data (e.g., functional status, nursing home admissions), and the availability of long-term follow-up data on mortality for analysis only in 2014.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first trial to our knowledge demonstrating that a collaborative care model of HRA in community-dwelling older people not only results in better health behaviours and increased use of recommended preventive care interventions, but also improves survival. The intervention tested in our study may serve as a model of how to implement a relatively low-cost but effective programme of disease prevention and health promotion in older individuals.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nTRIAL REGISTRATION: International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number: ISRCTN 28458424.},

This article is a summary of a literature review concerning the methodology for calculating deprivation indices showing differences in research on deprivation. Reports, carried out on behalf of public administrations as well as academic articles from ten socially and economically developed countries, although diversified, were analysed. Partial indicators from the indices were classified into eight thematic groups representing different deprivation dimensions. A total of 166 partial indicators were analysed. Moreover, other methods of researching social crisis phenomena were discussed i.e. the indices employed by the UN and the USA. In the analysed countries, indicators of education and living conditions were considered most frequently while those relating to health and crime the least. The most common partial indicators are average levels of income, unemployment, overcrowding and education.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

We show, using dimensionality reduction techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and for the first time information filtering and hierarchical clustering, that these composite indicators miss key information on the relationship between different indicators. In particular, the grouping of indicators via topics is not reflected in the data at a global and local level. We overcome these issues by using the clustering of indicators to build a new set of cluster driven composite development indicators that are objective, data driven, comparable between countries, and retain interpretabilty. We discuss their consequences on informing policy makers about country development, comparing them with the top PageRank indicators as a benchmark. Finally, we demonstrate that our new set of composite development indicators outperforms the benchmark on a dataset reconstruction task.},

  abstract = {Green space may improve health by enabling physical activity and recovery from stress or by decreased pollution levels. We investigated the association between residential green (greenness or green space) and mortality in adults using the Swiss National Cohort (SNC) by mutually considering air pollution and transportation noise exposure. To reflect residential green at the address level, two different metrics were derived: normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) for greenness, and high resolution land use classification data to identify green spaces (LU-green). We used stratified Cox proportional hazard models (stratified by sex) to study the association between exposure and all natural cause mortality, respiratory and cardiovascular disease (CVD), including ischemic heart disease, stroke and hypertension related mortality. Models were adjusted for civil status, job position, education, neighbourhood socio-economic position (SEP), geographic region, area type, altitude, air pollution (PM10), and transportation noise. From the nation-wide SNC, 4.2 million adults were included providing 7.8years of follow-up and respectively 363,553, 85,314 and 232,322 natural cause, respiratory and CVD deaths. Hazard ratios (and 95\%-confidence intervals) for NDVI [and LU-green] per interquartile range within 500m of residence were highly comparable: 0.94 (0.93–0.95) [0.94 (0.93–0.95)] for natural causes; 0.92 (0.91–0.94) [0.92 (0.90–0.95)] for respiratory; and 0.95 (0.94–0.96) [0.96 (0.95–0.98)] for CVD mortality. Protective effects were stronger in younger individuals and in women and, for most outcomes, in urban (vs. rural) and in the highest (vs. lowest) SEP quartile. Estimates remained virtually unchanged after incremental adjustment for air pollution and transportation noise, and mediation by these environmental factors was found to be small. We found consistent evidence that residential green reduced the risk of mortality independently from other environmental exposures. This suggests the protective effect goes beyond the absence of pollution sources. Environmental public health measures should not only aim at reducing pollutant exposure, but additionally maintain existing and increase residential green in areas where lacking.},

  abstract = {Background A paucity of data has made it challenging to construct a deprivation index at the lowest administrative, or county, level in China. An index is required to guide health equity monitoring and resource allocation to regions of greatest need. This study used China’s 2010 census data to construct a county-level area deprivation index (CADI). Methods Data for 2869 counties from China’s 2010 census were used to generate a CADI. Eleven indicators across four domains of deprivation were selected for principal component analysis with standardisation of the first principal component. Sensitivity analysis was used to test whether the population size and weighting method affected the index’s robustness. Deprived counties identified by the CADI were then compared with China’s official list of poverty-stricken counties. Results The first principal component explained 60.38\% of the total variation in the deprivation indicators. The CADI ranged from the least deprived value of −2.71 to the most deprived value of 2.92, with SD of 1. The CADI was found to be robust against county-level population size and different weighting methods. When compared with the official list of poverty-stricken counties in China, the deprived counties identified by the CADI were found to be even more deprived. Conclusion Constructing a robust area deprivation index for China at the county level based on population census data is feasible. The CADI is a potential policy tool to identify China’s most deprived areas. In the future, it may support health equity monitoring and comparison at the national and subnational levels.},

Although both sets of studies are extremely rigorous, high quality research outputs they are only able to provide a snapshot of the national distribution of relative socio-economic deprivation at fixed points in time. The inability to express deprivation levels as an extended and current time series means that not only are policy analysts and researchers working with outdated information, but also that it is often unfeasible to associate changes in deprivation levels to specific events or policy implementations. The Dynamic Deprivation Index (DDI) assigns a deprivation score and deprivation index to each area unit in New Zealand on a monthly basis. In this paper we look to describe the methodology behind the construction of the DDI and to validate the results therein. We argue that if public bodies were to make the data they hold more easily accessible, then there is no reason why New Zealand should not be able to benefit from a measure of socio-economic deprivation that combines the sophistication of the NZDEP studies or IMD with the contemporaneousness of the DDI.},

  abstract = {Neighborhood delineation is increasingly relied upon in urban social science research to identify the most appropriate spatial unit. In problems of this type, the true number of neighborhoods (typically called the k parameter) is unknown and analysts often require algorithmic approaches to determine k endogenously. Existing approaches for neighborhood delineation that do not require pre-specification of a k-parameter, however, are either nonspatial or lead to noncontiguous or overlapping regions. In this paper, we propose the use of max-p-regions for neighborhood delineation so that the geographic space can be partitioned into a set of homogeneous and geographically contiguous neighborhoods. In addition, we developed a new efficient algorithm to address the computational challenges associated with solving the max-p-regions so that it can be applied for large-scale neighborhood delineation. This new algorithm is implemented in the open-source Python Spatial Analysis Library (PySAL). Computational experiments based on both simulated and realistic data sets are performed and the results demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency.},

  abstract = {Background Compared to other OECD countries, Switzerland has the highest rates of hip (HA) and knee arthroplasty (KA). Objective We assessed the regional variation in HA/KA rates and potential determinants of variation in Switzerland. Methods We conducted a population-based analysis using discharge data from all Swiss hospitals during 2013–2016. We derived hospital service areas (HSAs) by analyzing patient flows. We calculated age-/sex-standardized procedure rates and measures of variation (the extremal quotient [EQ, highest divided by lowest rate] and the systemic component of variation [SCV]). We estimated the reduction in variance of HA/KA rates across HSAs in multilevel regression models, with incremental adjustment for procedure year, age, sex, language, urbanization, socioeconomic factors, burden of disease, and the number of orthopedic surgeons. Results Overall, 69,578 HA and 69,899 KA from 55 HSAs were analyzed. The mean age-/sex-standardized HA rate was 265 (range 179–342) and KA rate was 256 (range 186–378) per 100,000 persons and increased over time. The EQ was 1.9 for HA and 2.5 for KA. The SCV was 2.0 for HA and 2.2 for KA, indicating a low variation across HSAs. When adjusted for procedure year and demographic, cultural, and sociodemographic factors, the models explained 75\% of the variance in HA and 63\% in KA across Swiss HSAs. Conclusion Switzerland has high HA/KA rates with a modest regional variation, suggesting that the threshold to perform HA/KA may be uniformly low across regions. One third of the variation remained unexplained and may, at least in part, represent differing physician beliefs and attitudes towards joint arthroplasty.},

  abstract = {Lead exposure adversely affects children's health. Exposure in the United States is highest among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals who disproportionately live in substandard housing. We used Bayesian binomial regression models to estimate a neighborhood deprivation index and its association with elevated blood lead level (EBLL) risk using blood lead level testing data in Maryland census tracts. Our results show the probability of EBLL was spatially structured with high values in Baltimore city and low values in the District of Columbia suburbs and Baltimore suburbs. The association between the neighborhood deprivation index and EBLL risk was statistically significant after accounting for spatial dependence in probability of EBLL. The percent of houses built before 1940, African Americans, and renter occupied housing were the most important variables in the index. Bayesian models provide a flexible one-step approach to modeling risk associated with neighborhood deprivation while accounting for spatially structured and unstructured heterogeneity in risk.},

  abstract = {Recently, some studies have shown that human movement patterns are strongly associated with regional socioeconomic indicators such as per capita income and poverty rate. These studies, however, are limited in numbers and they have not reached a consensus on what indicators or how effectively they can possibly be used to reflect the socioeconomic characteristics of the underlying populations. In this study, we propose an analytical framework — by coupling large scale mobile phone and urban socioeconomic datasets — to better understand human mobility patterns and their relationships with travelers' socioeconomic status (SES). Six mobility indicators, which include radius of gyration, number of activity locations, activity entropy, travel diversity, k-radius of gyration, and unicity, are derived to quantify important aspects of mobile phone users' mobility characteristics. A data fusion approach is proposed to approximate, at an aggregate level, the SES of mobile phone users. Using Singapore and Boston as case studies, we compare the statistical properties of the six mobility indicators in the two cities and analyze how they vary across socioeconomic classes. The results provide a multifaceted view of the relationships between mobility and SES. Specifically, it is found that phone user groups that are generally richer tend to travel shorter in Singapore but longer in Boston. One of the potential reasons, as suggested by our analysis, is that the rich neighborhoods in the two cities are respectively central and peripheral. For three other mobility indicators that reflect the diversity of individual travel and activity patterns (i.e., number of activity locations, activity entropy, and travel diversity), we find that for both cities, phone users across different socioeconomic classes exhibit very similar characteristics. This indicates that wealth level, at least in Singapore and Boston, is not a factor that restricts how people travel around in the city. In sum, our comparative analysis suggests that the relationship between mobility and SES could vary among cities, and such relationship is influenced by the spatial arrangement of housing, employment opportunities, and human activities.},

Academic research has found some explanations, but the causes of the migrant mortality paradox are still partially unknown. Individual factors are generally seen as the fundamental causes of death, but recent research showed that social, economic and cultural environments also produce inequalities in mortality. This article aims at determining the influence of socioeconomic, cultural and geographic contexts in explaining the mortality differences between migrants and natives. In running multilevel bayesian models, the authors decompose spatial inequalities in mortality between migrants and natives within Swiss municipalities and neighborhoods.},
