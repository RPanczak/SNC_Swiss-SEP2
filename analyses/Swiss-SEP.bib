Treatment success for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or stroke depends on timely treatment. We examined the relationship between distance to different hospital types and mortality from AMI or stroke in the Swiss National Cohort (SNC) Study. Design and setting The SNC is a longitudinal mortality study of the census 2000 population of Switzerland. For 4.5 million Swiss residents not living in a nursing home and older than 30 years in the year 2000, we calculated driving time and straight-line distance from their home to the nearest acute, acute with emergency room, central and university hospital (in total 173 hospitals). On the basis of quintiles, we used multivariable Cox proportional hazard models to estimate HRs of AMI and stroke mortality for driving time distance groups compared to the closest distance group. Results Over 8 years, 19 301 AMI and 21 931 stroke deaths occurred. Mean driving time to the nearest acute hospital was 6.5 min (29.7 min to a university hospital). For AMI mortality, driving time to a university hospital showed the strongest association among the four types of hospitals with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.19 (95\% CI 1.10 to 1.30) and 1.10 (95\% CI 1.01 to 1.20) for men and women aged 65+ years when comparing the highest quintile with the lowest quintile of driving time. For stroke mortality, the association with university hospital driving time was less pronounced than for AMI mortality and did not show a clear incremental pattern with increasing driving time. There was no association with driving time to the nearest hospital. Conclusions The increasing AMI mortality with increasing driving time to the nearest university hospital but not to any nearest hospital reflects a complex interplay of many factors along the care pathway.},

Analyses were based on 1306 children and adolescents (6\&ndash;16 years) participating in the population-based SOPHYA-study. Accelerometers were used to assess SBT, the perceived environment was examined by a validated parental questionnaire, and objective environmental data were allocated using GIS (ArcMap 10.2, Esri, Redlands, CA, USA) for each family\&rsquo;s residential address. A high perceived safety was associated with less SBT. Boys, those whose residential neighbourhood was characterized by dead ends in urban areas, a low main street density in the neighbourhood of children and greenness were less likely to exhibit SBT. The association of the objective environment with the respective parental perceptions was low and no significant mediating effect was found for the perceived environment. We conclude for land-use planning to reduce sedentary behaviour objective environments should be complemented with efforts to increase parental sense of security.},

Methods: We combined data of 1742 youth (ages 4 to 17) from seven studies conducted within Switzerland between 2005-2010. All youth provided accelerometer data and a home address, which was linked to objective environmental data and the Swiss-SEP-index. Associations between neighborhood attributes and PA were analyzed by multivariable multilevel regression analyses. Results: The extent of green areas and building density was positively associated with PA in the total sample (p. {$<$}. 0.05). Factors representing centrally located areas, and more schoolchildren living nearby tended to increase PA in secondary schoolchildren, boys and those from lower-ranked socioeconomic areas. In primary schoolchildren, the extent of green areas was positively associated with PA (p. = 0.05). Associations between neighborhood attributes and PA were more pronounced in youth from low socioeconomic areas. Conclusions: The results indicate that some associations between neighborhood attributes and PA differ by age, sex and socioeconomic area. This should be taken into account when planning interventions to increase childhood PA.},

However, the impact of adverse collective circumstances – such as the socio-economic context where people live - is less well understood. This systematic review explores the extent to which area-level socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with inequalities in suicidal behaviour and self-harm in Europe. We performed a systematic review (in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, EconLit and Social Sciences Citation Index) from 2005 to 2015. Observational studies were included if they were based in Europe and had a primary suicidal behaviour and self-harm outcome, compared at least two areas, included an area-level measure of socio-economic disadvantage and were published in the English language. The review followed The Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines for quality appraisal. We identified 27 studies (30 papers) from 14 different European countries. There was a significant association (in 25/27 studies, all of which were rated as of medium or high quality) between socioeconomic disadvantage and suicidal behaviour (and self-harm), particularly for men, and this was a consistent finding across a variety of European countries. Socio-economic disadvantage was found to have an independent effect in several studies whilst others found evidence of mediating contextual and compositional factors. There is strong evidence of an association between suicidal behaviours (and self-harm) and area-level socio-economic disadvantage in Europe, particularly for men. Suicide prevention strategies should take this into account.},

Methods Between 2012 and 2018, we included adult renal transplant patients (aged ≥18 years) with pre-transplant assessment SAI scores, calculated from a STCS Psychosocial Questionnaire. Time to all-cause mortality and return to dialysis were predicted using Cox regression. Results Of 1238 included patients (mean age: 53.8±13.2 years; 37.9\% female; median follow-up time: 4.4 years (IQR: 2.7)), 93 (7.5\%) died and 57 (4.6\%) returned to dialysis.

Information was obtained on the publication and methodology (design and study areas, information sources, health and socioeconomic indicators, and statistical analysis). Results: We included 142 studies published since 1988 (58.4\% since 2005). More than half (59.9\%) were in English. The level of analysis was ecological in 73.2\% and multilevel in 19.0\%. The areas most frequently analyzed were census tracts (35 studies), especially within cities or autonomous regions, followed by the provinces (30 studies), mostly concerning Spain overall. The dependent variable most frequently analyzed was mortality and the socioeconomic dimension most commonly used was employment (71.1\%).

We aimed to understand how socio-economic status (SES), defined as the Swiss socio-economic position (SSEP), is associated with cardiometabolic parameters after initiation of psychotropic medications known to induce weight gain. Cardiometabolic parameters were collected in two Swiss cohorts following the prescription of psychotropic medications. The SSEP integrated neighborhood-based income, education, occupation, and housing condition. The results were then validated in an independent replication sample (UKBiobank), using educational attainment (EA) as a proxy for SES. Adult patients with a low SSEP had a higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome over one year versus patients with a high SSEP (Hazard ratio (95\% CI)\,=\,3.1 (1.5–6.5), n\,=\,366). During the first 6 months of follow-up, a significant negative association between SSEP and body mass index (BMI), weight change, and waist circumference change was observed (25\,≤\,age\,{$<$}\,65, n\,=\,526), which was particularly important in adults receiving medications with the highest risk of weight gain, with a BMI difference of 0.86\,kg/m2 between patients with low versus high SSEP (95\% CI: 0.03–1.70, n\,=\,99). Eventually, a causal effect of EA on BMI was revealed using Mendelian randomization in the UKBiobank, which was notably strong in high-risk medication users (beta: −0.47\,SD EA per 1\,SD BMI; 95\% CI: −0.46 to −0.27, n\,=\,11,314). An additional aspect of personalized medicine was highlighted, suggesting the patients’ SES represents a significant risk factor. Particular attention should be paid to patients with low SES when initiating high cardiometabolic risk psychotropic medications.},

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective and prospective cross-sectional study with women diagnosed with CIN3+ in Switzerland. Ten pathology institutes from six cantons and three language regions participated. We conducted HPV typing on formaldehyde fixed-paraffin embedded specimens from 2014 and 2015. Women enrolled in 2015 were asked to complete a questionnaire. We described frequencies of HPV types. We also compared demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status in the CIN3 + plus group with the Swiss National Cohort in 2014 and compared risk factors for HPV infection with the Swiss Health Survey in 2012. RESULTS: We included 768 biopsies from 767 women. Four hundred and seventy-five (61.8\%) biopsies were positive for HPV 16 and/or 18, 687 (89.5\%) were positive for oncogenic HPV genotypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and/or 58 and five (0.7\%) were HPV negative. Twenty-eight (10.3\%) of the 273 women who completed the patient questionnaire reported having received at least one dose of an HPV vaccine. When compared with Swiss women in the six study cantons, fewer women in the CIN3+ plus study group were of Swiss nationality, more were born abroad and more were single. The study group also had a higher proportion of women with {$>$}/=2 partners in the last year, current smokers and was younger at age of first sexual intercourse. CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of the nonavalent vaccine could cover approximately 90\% of CIN3+ lesions in Swiss women compared with around 60\% with the quadrivalent vaccine. Surveillance of HPV genotype distribution in CIN3+, together with information about vaccination and CIN3+ incidence will allow monitoring of the public health impact of vaccination programmes.

  abstract = {Background: In 2011, WHO growth curves replaced those of Prader and colleagues (First Zurich longitudinal study) in Switzerland.Aim: To present contemporary height-, weight- and body mass index (BMI)-for-age references reflecting children’s growth in modern Switzerland.Subjects and methods: Cross-sectional sample comprising 30,141 boys and girls aged 0–20 years measured between 2012 and 2019. Height, weight and BMI reference curves were created using the LMS method. Derived percentiles were compared with those of Prader, WHO and neighbouring countries.Results: Growth in the first 5 years is almost identical with Prader curves. Thereafter children are taller, yet their final height is only about 1 cm higher. Today’s children, in particular boys, are considerably heavier. In comparison with WHO growth references, Swiss children are taller from the second year until adulthood; the WHO 3rd percentiles lie about 4 cm below those of our updated references. Weight and BMI median percentiles from our sample are similar to those of WHO and higher than the Prader curves. However, the course of the 97th BMI percentile WHO curves extends well below the 97th percentile of the updated Swiss curves.Conclusion: This study provides contemporary reference data for assessing individual growth based on height, weight and BMI of Swiss children.},

  abstract = {Introduction and objectives Air pollution and insufficient physical activity have been associated with inflammation and oxidative stress, molecular mechanisms linked to arterial stiffness and cardiovascular disease. There are no studies on how physical activity modifies the association between air pollution and arterial stiffness. We examined whether the adverse cardiovascular effects of air pollution were modified by individual physical activity levels in 2823 adults aged 50–81 years from the well-characterized Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases (SAPALDIA). Methods We assessed arterial stiffness as the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV [m/s]) with an oscillometric device. We administered a self-reported physical activity questionnaire to classify each subject’s physical activity level. Air pollution exposure was estimated by the annual average individual home outdoor PM10 and PM2.5 (particulate matter {$<$}10μm and {$<$}2.5μm in diameter, respectively) and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) exposure estimated for the year preceding the survey. Exposure estimates for ultrafine particles calculated as particle number concentration (PNC) and lung deposited surface area (LDSA) were available for a subsample (N=1353). We used mixed effects logistic regression models to regress increased arterial stiffness (baPWV≥14.4m/s) on air pollution exposure and physical activity while adjusting for relevant confounders. Results We found evidence that the association of air pollution exposure with baPWV was different between inactive and active participants. The probability of having increased baPWV was significantly higher with higher PM10, PM2.5, NO2, PNC and LDSA exposure in inactive, but not in physically active participants. We found some evidence of an interaction between physical activity and ambient air pollution exposure for PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 (pinteraction=0.06, 0.09, and 0.04, respectively), but not PNC and LDSA (pinteraction=0.32 and 0.35). Conclusions Our study provides some indication that physical activity may protect against the adverse vascular effects of air pollution in low pollution settings. Additional research in large prospective cohorts is needed to assess whether the observed effect modification translates to high pollution settings in mega-cities of middle and low-income countries.},

  abstract = {Air pollution is an important risk factor for global burden of disease. There has been recent interest in its possible role in the etiology of diabetes mellitus. Experimental evidence is suggestive, but epidemiological evidence is limited and mixed. We therefore explored the association between air pollution and prevalent diabetes, in a population-based Swiss cohort. We did cross-sectional analyses of 6392 participants of the Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults [SAPALDIA], aged between 29 and 73years. We used estimates of average individual home outdoor PM10 [particulate matter {$<$}10??m in diameter] and NO2 [nitrogen dioxide] exposure over the 10years preceding the survey. Their association with diabetes was modeled using mixed logistic regression models, including participants' study area as random effect, with incremental adjustment for confounders. There were 315 cases of diabetes (prevalence: 5.5\% [95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.8, 7.2\%]). Both PM10 and NO2 were associated with prevalent diabetes with respective odds ratios of 1.40 [95\% CI: 1.17, 1.67] and 1.19 [95\% CI: 1.03, 1.38] per 10??g/m3 increase in the average home outdoor level. Associations with PM10 were generally stronger than with NO2, even in the two-pollutant model. There was some indication that beta blockers mitigated the effect of PM10. The associations remained stable across different sensitivity analyses. Our study adds to the evidence that long term air pollution exposure is associated with diabetes mellitus. PM10 appears to be a useful marker of aspects of air pollution relevant for diabetes. This association can be observed at concentrations below air quality guidelines. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

  abstract = {Exposure to ambient air pollution (AP) exposure has been linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. Evidence on the impact of T2D genetic variants on AP susceptibility is lacking. Compared to single variants, joint genetic variants contribute substantially to disease risk. We investigated the modification of AP and diabetes association by a genetic risk score (GRS) covering 63 T2D genes in 1524 first follow-up participants of the Swiss cohort study on air pollution and lung and heart diseases in adults. Genome-wide data and covariates were available from a nested asthma case-control study design. AP was estimated as 10-year mean residential particulate matter {$<$}10 ??m (PM10). We computed count-GRS and weighted-GRS, and applied PM10 interaction terms in mixed logistic regressions, on odds of diabetes. Analyses were stratified by pathways of diabetes pathology and by asthma status. Diabetes prevalence was 4.6\% and mean exposure to PM10 was 22 ??g/m3. Odds of diabetes increased by 8\% (95\% confidence interval: 2, 14\%) per T2D risk allele and by 35\% (-8, 97\%) per 10 ??g/m3 exposure to PM10. We observed a positive interaction between PM10 and count-GRS on diabetes [ORinteraction = 1.10 (1.01, 1.20)], associations being strongest among participants at the highest quartile of count-GRS [OR: 1.97 (1.00, 3.87)]. Stronger interactions were observed with variants of the GRS involved in insulin resistance [(ORinteraction = 1.22 (1.00, 1.50)] than with variants related to beta-cell function. Interactions with count-GRS were stronger among asthma cases. We observed similar results with weighted-GRS. Five single variants near GRB14, UBE2E2, PTPRD, VPS26A and KCNQ1 showed nominally significant interactions with PM10 (P {$<$} 0.05). Our results suggest that genetic risk for T2D may modify susceptibility to air pollution through alterations in insulin sensitivity. These results need confirmation in diabetes cohort consortia.},

However, epidemiologic evidence on associations of objective transportation noise exposure and also perceived noise annoyance with respiratory morbidity is limited. We investigated independent associations of transportation noise exposure and noise annoyance with prevalent respiratory symptoms and incident asthma in adults. Using 17,138 observations (from 7049 participants) from three SAPALDIA (Swiss Cohort Study on Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults) surveys, we assessed associations of transportation noise exposure and noise annoyance with prevalent respiratory symptoms, and with incident asthma (in 10,657 nested observations from 6377 participants). Annual day-evening-night transportation noise comprising road, railway and aircraft Lden (Transportation Lden) was calculated for the most exposed façade of participants' residence using Swiss noise models. Transportation noise annoyance was assessed using an 11-point scale, and participants reported respiratory symptoms and doctor-diagnosed asthma at each survey. We estimated associations with transportation Lden (as well as source-specific Lden) and noise annoyance, independent of air pollution and other potential confounders, using mutually-adjusted mixed logistic and Poisson models and applying random intercepts at the level of the participants. Prevalent respiratory symptoms ranged from 5\% (nocturnal dyspnoea) to 23\% (regular cough/phlegm). Transportation noise annoyance, but not Lden, was independently associated with respiratory symptoms and current asthma in all participants, with odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) ranging between 1.03 (95\%CI: 1.01, 1.06) and 1.07 (95\% CI: 1.04, 1.11) per 1-point difference in noise annoyance. Both noise annoyance and Lden showed independent associations with asthma symptoms among asthmatics, especially in those reporting adult-onset asthma [ORLden: 1.90 (95\% CI: 1.25, 2.89) per 10 dB; p-value of interaction (adult-onset vs. childhood-onset): 0.03; ORnoise annoyance: 1.06 (95\%CI: 0.97, 1.16) per 1-point difference; p-value of interaction: 0.06]. No associations were found with incident asthma. Transportation noise level and annoyance contributed to symptom exacerbation in adult asthma. This suggests both psychological and physiological noise reactions on the respiratory system, and could be relevant for asthma care. More studies are needed to better understand the effects of objective and perceived noise in asthma aetiology and overall respiratory health.},

CONCLUSIONS: Mutually independent DNA methylation was associated with source-specific transportation noise and air pollution exposures, with distinct and shared enrichments for pathways related to inflammation, cellular development, and immune responses. These findings contribute in clarifying the pathways linking these exposures and age-related diseases but need further confirmation in the context of mediation analyses. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6174.},

  abstract = {Prospective evidence on the risk of depression in relation to transportation noise exposure and noise annoyance is limited and mixed. We aimed to investigate the associations of long-term exposure to source-specific transportation noise and noise annoyance with incidence of depression in the SAPALDIA (Swiss cohort study on air pollution and lung and heart diseases in adults) cohort. We investigated 4,581 SAPALDIA participants without depression in the year 2001/2002. Corresponding one-year mean road, railway and aircraft day-evening-night noise (Lden) was calculated at the most exposed façade of the participants’ residential floors, and transportation noise annoyance was assessed on an 11-point scale. Incident cases of depression were identified in 2010/2011, and comprised participants reporting physician diagnosis, intake of antidepressant medication or having a short form-36 mental health score~{$<~$}50. We used robust Poisson regressions to estimate the mutually adjusted relative risks (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) of depression, independent of traffic-related air pollution and other potential confounders. Incidence of depression was 11 cases per 1,000 person-years. In single exposure models, we observed positive but in part, statistically non-significant associations (per 10~dB) of road traffic Lden [RR: 1.06 (0.93, 1.22)] and aircraft Lden [RR: 1.19 (0.93, 1.53)], and (per 1-point difference) of noise annoyance [RR: 1.05 (1.02, 1.08)] with depression risk. In multi-exposure model, noise annoyance effect remained unchanged, with weaker effects of road traffic Lden [(RR: 1.02 (0.89, 1.17)] and aircraft Lden [(RR: 1.17 (0.90, 1.50)]. However, there were statistically significant indirect effects of road traffic Lden [(β: 0.02 (0.01, 0.03)] and aircraft Lden [β: 0.01 (0.002, 0.02)] via noise annoyance. There were no associations with railway Lden in the single and multi-exposure models [(RRboth models: 0.88 (0.75, 1.03)]. We made similar findings among 2,885 non-movers, where the effect modification and cumulative risks were more distinct. Noise annoyance effect in non-movers was stronger among the insufficiently active (RR: 1.09; 95\%CI: 1.02, 1.17; pinteraction~=~0.07) and those with daytime sleepiness [RR: 1.07 (1.02, 1.12); pinteraction~=~0.008]. Cumulative risks of Lden in non-movers showed additive tendencies for the linear cumulative risk [(RRper 10dB of combined sources: 1.31 (0.90, 1.91)] and the categorical cumulative risk [(RRtriple- vs. zero-source ≥45 dB: 2.29 (1.02, 5.14)], and remained stable to noise annoyance. Transportation noise level and noise annoyance may jointly and independently influence the risk of depression. Combined long-term exposures to noise level seems to be most detrimental, largely acting via annoyance. The moderation of noise annoyance effect by daytime sleepiness and physical activity further contribute to clarifying the involved mechanisms. More evidence is needed to confirm these findings for effective public health control of depression and noise exposure burden.},

We hypothesize that night-time road traffic noise (RTN) may impair glucose homeostasis through circadian rhythm disturbances. We prospectively investigated the relationship between residential night-time RTN and subsequent eight-year change in glycosylated hemoglobin (ΔHbA1c) in 3350 participants of the Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults (SAPALDIA), adjusting for diabetes risk factors and air pollution levels. Annual average RTN (Lnight) was assigned to participants in 2001 using validated Swiss noise models. HbA1c was measured in 2002 and 2011 using liquid chromatography. We applied mixed linear models to explore RTN-ΔHbA1c association and its modification by a genetic risk score of six common circadian-related MTNR1B variants (MGRS). A 10 dB difference in RTN was associated with a 0.02\% (0.003-0.04\%) increase in mean ΔHbA1c in 2142 non-movers. RTN-ΔHbA1c association was modified by MGRS among diabetic participants (Pinteraction = 0.001). A similar trend in non-diabetic participants was non-significant. Among the single variants, we observed strongest interactions with rs10830963, an acknowledged diabetes risk variant also implicated in melatonin profile dysregulation. Night-time RTN may impair glycemic control, especially in diabetic individuals, through circadian rhythm disturbances. Experimental sleep studies are needed to test whether noise control may help individuals to attain optimal glycemic levels.},

  abstract = {Air pollutants (AP) play a role in subclinical inflammation, and are associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is inflammatory and precedes cardiovascular morbidity and type 2 diabetes. Thus, a positive association between AP and MetS may be hypothesized. We explored this association, (taking into account, pathway-specific MetS definitions), and its potential modifiers in Swiss adults. We studied 3769 participants of the Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults, reporting at least four-hour fasting time before venepuncture. AP exposures were 10-year mean residential PM10 (particulate matter {$<$}10𝜇m in diameter) and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide). Outcomes included MetS defined by World Health Organization (MetS-W), International Diabetes Federation (MetS-I) and Adult Treatment Panel-III (MetS-A) using four- and eight-hour fasting time limits. We also explored associations with individual components of MetS. We applied mixed logistic regression models to explore these associations. The prevalence of MetS-W, MetS-I and MetS-A were 10\%, 22\% and 18\% respectively. Odds of MetS-W, MetS-I and MetS-A increased by 72\% (51-102\%), 31\% (11-54\%) and 18\% (4-34\%) per 10𝜇g/m3 increase in 10-year mean PM10. We observed weaker associations with NO2. Associations were stronger among physically-active, ever-smokers and non-diabetic participants especially with PM10 (p{$<$}0.05). Associations remained robust across various sensitivity analyses including ten imputations of missing observations and exclusion of diabetes cases. The observed associations between AP exposure and MetS were sensitive to MetS definitions. Regarding the MetS components, we observed strongest associations with impaired fasting glycemia, and positive but weaker associations with hypertension and waist-circumference-based obesity. Cardio-metabolic effects of AP may be majorly driven by impairment of glucose homeostasis, and to a less-strong extent, visceral adiposity. Well-designed prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.}

  abstract = {Background Living at higher altitude was dose-dependently associated with lower risk of ischaemic heart disease (IHD). Higher altitudes have different climatic, topographic and built environment properties than lowland regions. It is unclear whether these environmental factors mediate/confound the association between altitude and IHD. We examined how much of the altitude-IHD association is explained by variations in exposure at place of residence to sunshine, temperature, precipitation, aspect, slope and distance to main road. Methods We included 4.2 million individuals aged 40–84 at baseline living in Switzerland at altitudes 195–2971 m above sea level (ie, full range of residence), providing 77 127 IHD deaths. Mortality data 2000–2008, sociodemographic/economic information and coordinates of residence were obtained from the Swiss National Cohort, a longitudinal, census-based record linkage study. Environment information was modelled to residence level using Weibull regression models. Results In the model not adjusted for other environmental factors, IHD mortality linearly decreased with increasing altitude resulting in a lower risk (HR, 95\% CI 0.67, 0.60 to 0.74) for those living {$>$}1500 m (vs{$<$}600 m). This association remained after adjustment for all other environmental factors 0.74 (0.66 to 0.82). Conclusions The benefit of living at higher altitude was only partially confounded by variations in climate, topography and built environment. Rather, physical environment factors appear to have an independent effect and may impact on cardiovascular health in a cumulative way. Inclusion of additional modifiable factors as well as individual information on traditional IHD risk factors in our combined environmental model could help to identify strategies for the reduction of inequalities in IHD mortality.},

We removed all urban areas as identified by the Office for National Statistics Rural–Urban Area Classifications and mapped the Carstairs2011 and IMD2010 across the remaining rural areas using rural-specific quintiles.Our method was effective in displaying much greater heterogeneity in rural areas than was apparent in the original indices. We received positive feedback from Directors of Public Health who confirmed that the observed patterns mirror their experiences and first-hand knowledge on the ground.Our maps of Carstairs2011 and IMD2010 for rural areas might strengthen the evidence base for rural planning and service provision. The modified deprivation indices, however, were not specifically formulated for rural populations and further work is needed to explore alternative input variables to produce a more rural-specific measure of deprivation.}

Tumor stage was classified according to Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program summary stage (in situ/localized/regional/distant). We used highest education level attained to estimate SEP (low/middle/high). Further demographic characteristics of interest were age at presentation (30–49/50–69/70–84 years), living in a canton with organized screening (yes/no), urbanity of residence (urban/peri-urban/rural), civil status (single/married/widowed/divorced) and nationality (Swiss/non-Swiss). We used ordered logistic regression models to analyze factors associated with BC stage at presentation and competing risk regression models for factors associated with survival. Odds of later-stage BC were significantly increased for low SEP women (odds ratio 1.19, 95\%CI 1.06–1.34) compared to women of high SEP. Further, women living in a canton without organized screening program, women diagnosed outside the targeted screening age and single/widowed/divorced women were more often diagnosed at later stages. Women of low SEP experienced an increased risk of dying from BC (sub-hazard ratio 1.22, 95\%CI 1.05–1.43) compared to women of high SEP. Notably, these survival inequalities could not be explained by socioeconomic differences in stage at presentation and/or other sociodemographic factors.

  abstract = {Background Public health policies aim to prevent suicide in the general population. Assessing their effectiveness is required to further guide public health policies. The present article focuses on the French paradox. The French health care system was classified as the best in the world according the World Health Organization (WHO). However, suicide rates in France remain high compared to other European countries. The aim of the present article was to analyze (i) the evolution of suicide Age-Standardized Death (ASDRs) in France during the last three decades and the associations with socio-economic parameters and (ii) to understand which populations may specifically benefit from further targeted suicide prevention policies. Methods The database of the World Health Organization (WHO), freely available, was explored in April 2015. ASDRs were calculated each year by ratio between the number of deaths by suicide and the total population (per 100,000 inhabitants). Number of deaths by gender and age were also analyzed. Results Overall, ASDR suicide has decreased since 1987 in France (-32.8\% between 1987 and 2010). However, France kept the same rank (10/26) when compared to other European countries between 1987 and 2010. The relative burden of suicide in all-causes mortality increased during the same period (+28.2\%) while the total number of deaths by suicide increased only slightly (+3.9\%). More specifically, the number of deaths by suicide increased substantially in [35-54] years old (+40\%) and 75+ years old (+27\%) males, and in [35-54] (+41\%) years old females. Between 2000 and 2010, suicide rates significantly decreased when yearly mean income increased, and when general and psychiatric care beds decreased. Conclusion Although ASDR suicide has decreased in France since 1987, this decline is quite modest when considering its universal access to care, the prevention of depression and suicide public policies. Suicide prevention public policies should focus on evaluation and improvement of prevention and care in the [35-54] years old population, and in the males aged 75+.},

We investigated the association of long-term transportation NA and its main sources (aircraft, road, and railway) at home with PA levels. We assessed 3842 participants (aged 37-81) that attended the three examinations (SAP 1, 2, and 3 in years 1991, 2001 and 2011, respectively) of the population-based Swiss cohort on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults (SAPALDIA). Participants reported general 24-h transportation NA (in all examinations) and source-specific NA at night (only SAP 3) on an ICBEN-type 11-point scale. We assessed moderate, vigorous, and total PA from a short-questionnaire (SAP 3). The main outcome was moderate PA (active/inactive: cut-off ??? 150 min/week). We used logistic regression including random effects by area and adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and lifestyles (main model) and evaluated potential effect modifiers. We analyzed associations with PA at SAP 3 a) cross-sectionally: for source-specific and transportation NA in the last year (SAP 3), and b) longitudinally: for 10-y transportation NA (mean of SAP 1 + 2), adjusting for prior PA (SAP 2) and changes in NA (SAP 3-2). Reported NA (score ??? 5) was 16.4\%, 7.5\%, 3\%, and 1.1\% for 1-year transportation, road, aircraft, and railway at SAP 3, respectively. NA was greater in the past, reaching 28.5\% for 10-y transportation NA (SAP 1 + 2). The 10-y transportation NA was associated with a 3.2\% (95\% CI: 6\%-0.2\%) decrease in moderate PA per 1-NA rating point and was related to road and aircraft NA at night in cross-sectional analyses. The longitudinal association was stronger for women, reported daytime sleepiness or chronic diseases and it was not explained by objectively modeled levels of road traffic noise at SAP 3. In conclusion, long-term NA (related to psychological noise appraisal) reduced PA and could represent another noise pathway towards cardiometabolic diseases.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIFS: Les inégalités et les iniquités en santé sont un important problème de santé publique. En Suisse, la mortalité dans la population générale varie selon la position socio-économique (SEP) des quartiers. Nous avons examiné l'influence du quartier SEP sur la présentation et les résultats chez les personnes VIH-positives dans l'ère de la thérapie antirétrovirale combinée (CART).\textbackslash nMÉTHODES: Le quartier SEP patients suivis dans l'étude suisse VIH cohorte (SHCS) de 2000 à 2013 a été obtenue sur la base des données du recensement de 2000 sur les 50 ménages les plus proches (de l'éducation et de la profession du chef de ménage, le loyer, le nombre de personnes par chambre signifie ). Nous avons utilisé Cox et modèles de régression logistique pour examiner la probabilité de présentation tardive, la réponse virologique au panier, la perte pour le suivi et la mort dans les quintiles de quartier septembre\textbackslash nRÉSULTATS: Un total de 4489 participants SHCS ont été inclus. Présentation à un stade avancé [nombre de cellules CD4⁺ {$<$}200 cellules / ul ou le SIDA] et avec le sida était moins fréquente dans les quartiers Of sept supérieur: l'âge et les chances de sexe rapport ajusté (OR) comparant le plus élevé avec le quintile le plus bas de la SEP a été [intervalle de 95\% de confiance (IC à 95\%) de 0,58 à 0,87] 0,71 et 0,59 (IC à 95\% 0,45 à 0,77), respectivement. Une charge virale indétectable à 6 mois du chariot était plus fréquente dans le plus haut que dans le quintile le plus bas (OR 1,52; IC 95\% 1.14 à 2.4). Perte de suivi, la mortalité et les causes de la mort ne sont pas associés avec le quartier septembre\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: présentation tardive était plus fréquente et la réponse virologique au panier moins fréquente chez les personnes séropositives vivant dans les quartiers Of sept inférieur, mais contrairement à la population générale, il n'y avait pas de tendance claire pour la mortalité.\textbackslash n\textbackslash n\textbackslash nOBJECTIVES: Inequalities and inequities in health are an important public health concern. In Switzerland, mortality in the general population varies according to the socio-economic position (SEP) of neighbourhoods. We examined the influence of neighbourhood SEP on presentation and outcomes in HIV-positive individuals in the era of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).\textbackslash nMETHODS: The neighbourhood SEP of patients followed in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) 2000-2013 was obtained on the basis of 2000 census data on the 50 nearest households (education and occupation of household head, rent, mean number of persons per room). We used Cox and logistic regression models to examine the probability of late presentation, virologic response to cART, loss to follow-up and death across quintiles of neighbourhood SEP.\textbackslash nRESULTS: A total of 4489 SHCS participants were included. Presentation with advanced disease [CD4⁺ cell count {$<$}200 cells/𝜇l or AIDS] and with AIDS was less common in neighbourhoods of higher SEP: the age and sex-adjusted odds ratio (OR) comparing the highest with the lowest quintile of SEP was 0.71 [95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 0.58-0.87] and 0.59 (95\% CI 0.45-0.77), respectively. An undetectable viral load at 6 months of cART was more common in the highest than in the lowest quintile (OR 1.52; 95\% CI 1.14-2.04). Loss to follow-up, mortality and causes of death were not associated with neighbourhood SEP.\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Late presentation was more common and virologic response to cART less common in HIV-positive individuals living in neighbourhoods of lower SEP, but in contrast to the general population, there was no clear trend for mortality.},

To test this possibility, we investigated how variation in store-level food sales composition across Switzerland is associated with the mean Body Mass Index (BMI) of young men (Swiss Army conscripts) living near the stores. We obtained data on annual food sales (2011) for 553 stores from the largest supermarket chain in Switzerland, identified foods commonly regarded as \&ldquo;healthy\&rdquo; or \&ldquo;unhealthy\&rdquo; based on nutrient content, and determined their contribution to each store\&rsquo;s total sales (Swiss francs). We found that the sales percentages of both \&ldquo;healthy\&rdquo; and \&ldquo;unhealthy\&rdquo; food types varied by 2- to 3-fold among stores. Their balance ranged from \&minus;15.3\% to 18.0\% of total sales; it was positively associated with area-based socioeconomic position (r = 0.63) and negatively associated with the mean BMI of young men in the area (r = \&minus;0.42). Thus, even though we compared supermarkets from a single chain, different shopping behaviors of customers caused stores in privileged areas to sell relatively more healthy food. Knowledge about such patterns could help in designing in-store interventions for healthier nutrition and monitoring their effects over time.},

We investigated the association between transportation noise/air pollution exposure and death due to MI during the follow-up period 2000–08, by adjusting noise [Lden(Road), Lden(Railway), and Lden(Air)] estimates for NO2 and/or PM2.5 and vice versa by multipollutant Cox regression models considering potential confounders. Adjusting noise risk estimates of MI for NO2 and/or PM2.5 did not change the hazard ratios (HRs) per 10 dB increase in road traffic (without air pollution: 1.032, 95\% CI: 1.014–1.051, adjusted for NO2 and PM2.5: 1.034, 95\% CI: 1.014–1.055), railway traffic (1.020, 95\% CI: 1.007–1.033 vs. 1.020, 95\% CI: 1.007–1.033), and aircraft traffic noise (1.025, 95\% CI: 1.006–1.045 vs. 1.025, 95\% CI: 1.005–1.046). Conversely, noise adjusted HRs for air pollutants were lower than corresponding estimates without noise adjustment. Hazard ratio per 10 μg/m³ increase with and without noise adjustment were 1.024 (1.005–1.043) vs. 0.990 (0.965–1.016) for NO2 and 1.054 (1.013–1.093) vs. 1.019 (0.971–1.071) for PM2.5.Our study suggests that transportation noise is associated with MI mortality, independent from air pollution. Air pollution studies not adequately adjusting for transportation noise exposure may overestimate the cardiovascular disease burden of air pollution.}

  abstract = {Background: Most epidemiological noise studies consider 24 h average noise exposure levels. Our aim was to exploratively analyze the impact of noise exposure at different time windows during day and night on cardiovascular mortality. Methods: We generated Switzerland-wide exposure models for road traffic, railway and aircraft noise for different time windows for the year 2001. Combined noise source equivalent continuous sound levels (Leq) for different time windows at the most exposed façade were assigned to each of the 4.41 million Swiss National Cohort adult participants. Follow-up period was from 2000 to 2008. Hazard ratios (HR) of noise effects on various cardiovascular primary causes of death were computed by Cox regression models adjusted for potential confounders and NO2levels. Results: For most cardiovascular causes of death we obtained indications for a diurnal pattern. For ischemic heart disease the highest HR was observed for the core night hours from 01 h to 05 h (HR per standard deviation of Leq: 1.025, 95\% CI: 1.016–1.034) and lower HR for the daytime 07 h to 19 h (1.018 [1.009–1.028]). Heart failure and daytime Leqyielded the highest HR (1.047 [1.027–1.068]). Conclusion: For acute cardiovascular diseases, nocturnal intermittent noise exposure tended to be more relevant than daytime exposure, whereas it was the opposite for chronic conditions such as heart failure most strongly associated with continuous daytime noise. This suggests that for acute diseases sleep is an important mediator for health consequences of transportation noise.},

It is unclear if this possible link may be explained by exposure to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) or by electrical shocks. We evaluated ALS mortality in 2000-2008 and exposure to ELF-MF and electrical shocks in the Swiss National Cohort, using job exposure matrices for occupations at censuses 1990 and 2000. We compared 2.2 million workers with high or medium vs. low exposure to ELF-MF and electrical shocks using Cox proportional hazard models. Results showed that mortality from ALS was higher in people who had medium or high ELF-MF exposure in both censuses (HR 1.55 (95\% CI 1.11-2.15)), but closer to unity for electrical shocks (HR 1.17 (95\% CI 0.83-1.65)). When both exposures were included in the same model, the HR for ELF-MF changed little (HR 1.56), but the HR for electric shocks was attenuated to 0.97. In conclusion, there was an association between exposure to ELF-MF and mortality from ALS among workers with a higher likelihood of long-term exposure.},

We recently reported space-time clustering of CL around birth, and now aim to generate etiological hypotheses by comparing clustered and nonclustered cases. We also investigated whether the clustering resulted from many small aggregations of cases or from a few larger clusters. Methods We identified cases of persons born and diagnosed between 1985 and 2014 at age 0-15 years from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. We determined spatial and temporal lags that maximized evidence of clustering based on the Knox test and classified cases born within these lags from another case as clustered. Using logistic regression adjusted for child population density, we determined whether clustering status was associated with age at diagnosis, immunophenotype, cytogenetic subtype, perinatal and socioeconomic characteristics, and pollution sources. Results Analyses included 1,282 cases of which 242 were clustered (born within 1 km and 2 years from another case). Of all investigated characteristics only the t(12; 21)(p13; q22) translocation (resulting in ETV6-RUNX1 fusion) differed significantly in prevalence between clustered and nonclustered cases (40\% and 25\%, respectively; adjusted OR 2.54 \{[\}1.52-4.23]; p = 0.003). Spatio-temporal clustering was driven by an excess of aggregations of two or three children rather than by a few large clusters. Conclusion Our findings suggest ETV6-RUNX1 is associated with space-time clustering of CL and are consistent with an infection interacting with that oncogene in early life leading to clinical leukemia.}

The aim of this study was to develop geodemographic area classification based on several area-level indicators and to explore the extent of geographical inequalities in mortality. A series of 19 area-level socioeconomic indicators were used from the 2011 national population census. After normalization and standardization of the geographically smoothed indicators, the k-means cluster algorithm was implemented to classify communities into groups based on similar characteristics. The association between geodemographic area classification and the spatial distribution of mortality was estimated in Poisson log-linear spatial models. The k-means algorithm resulted in four distinct clusters of areas. The most characteristic distinction was between the ageing, socially isolated, and resource-scarce rural communities versus metropolitan areas with younger population, higher educational attainment, and professional occupations. By comparison to metropolitan areas, premature mortality appeared to be 44\% (95\% Credible Intervals [CrI] of Rate Ratio (RR): 1.06\&ndash;1.91) higher in traditional rural areas and 36\% (95\% CrI of RR: 1.13\&ndash;1.62) higher in young semi-rural areas. These findings warrant future epidemiological studies investigating various causes of the urban-rural differences in premature mortality and implementation policies to reduce the mortality gap between urban and rural areas.},

Disparities in health status due to socioeconomic conditions are unfair and can be prevented through appropriate health and social policies. The relation between socioeconomic factors and health outcomes can be proven at both the individual and geographic level. In this study, we follow the second stream of literature. The objective of the study is to measure how deprivation changes over time in an urban context, finding out whether socioeconomic inequalities association with health outcomes endure over time. To do so, a census-based deprivation index (GDI—Genoa Deprivation Index) have been developed using three aggregation methods—additive, Mazziotta–Pareto, and Pena distance. The innovation of the work is the attempt to evaluate deprivation over time, trying to formalize a methodological path replicable in other situation. Health status has been assessed using the standardized (premature) mortality ratios. The findings reveal that although deprivation inequalities continue to exist in Genoa, global levels have been decreasing. In addition, the rate of premature mortality has shown improvements. Despite this, GDI scores continue to be associated with premature deaths: individuals living in deprived areas report consistently high standardised mortality ratios.},

Measures of population mixing were calculated for all municipalities for the 5-year period preceding the 1990 and 2000 censuses. Analyses were based on 2,128,012 children of whom 536 developed CL. HRs comparing highest with lowest quintile of population growth were 1.11 [95 \% confidence interval (CI) 0.65-1.89] in rural and 0.59 (95 \% CI 0.43-0.81) in urban municipalities (interaction: p = 0.271). Results were similar for ALL and for CL at age {$<$}5 years. For level of in-migration there was evidence of a negative association with ALL.

There was little evidence of an association with diversity of origin. This nationwide cohort study of the association between CL and population growth, in-migration and diversity of origin provides little support for the population mixing hypothesis.},

Because exposure to infections is difficult to measure directly, epidemiological studies have used surrogate measures available from routine data such as birth order and population density. However, the association between population density and exposure to infections is unclear. We assessed whether neighbourhood child population density is associated with respiratory infections in infants. Methods With the Basel-Bern lung infant development study (BILD), a prospective Swiss cohort study of healthy neonates, respiratory symptoms and infections were assessed by weekly telephone interviews with the mother throughout the first year of life. Using population census data, we calculated neighbourhood child density as the number of children {$<$} 16 years of age living within a 250 m radius around the residence of each child. We used negative binomial regression models to assess associations between neighbourhood child density and the number of weeks with respiratory infections and adjusted for potential confounders including the number of older siblings, day-care attendance and duration of breastfeeding. We investigated possible interactions between neighbourhood child population density and older siblings assuming that older siblings mix with other children in the neighbourhood. Results The analyses included 487 infants. We found no evidence of an association between quintiles of neighbourhood child density and number of respiratory symptoms (p = 0.59, incidence rate ratios comparing highest to lowest quintile: 1.15, 95\%-confidence interval: 0.90–1.47). There was no evidence of interaction with older siblings (p = 0.44). Results were similar in crude and in fully adjusted models. Conclusions Our study suggests that in Switzerland neighbourhood child density is a poor proxy for exposure to infections in infancy.}

Exposure during childhood is associated with a greater excess relative risk for leukemia and tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) than exposure in later life. Cancer risks associated with low-dose exposure ({$<$}100~mSv) are uncertain. We previously investigated the association between the incidence of childhood cancer and levels of exposure to external background radiation from terrestrial gamma and cosmic rays in Switzerland using data from a nationwide census-based cohort study. Here, we provide an update of that study using an extended follow-up period and an improved exposure model. Methods We included all children 0–15 years of age registered in the Swiss national censuses 1990, 2000, and 2010–2015. We identified incident cancer cases during 1990–2016 using probabilistic record linkage with the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. Exposure to terrestrial and cosmic radiation at children's place of residence was estimated using geographic exposure models based on aerial spectrometric gamma-ray measurements. We estimated and included the contribution from 137Cs deposition after the Chernobyl accident. We created a nested case-control sample and fitted conditional logistic regression models adjusting for sex, year of birth, neighborhood socioeconomic position, and modelled outdoor NO2 concentration. We also estimated the population attributable fraction for childhood cancer due to external background radiation. Results We included 3,401,113 children and identified 3,137 incident cases of cancer, including 951 leukemia, 495 lymphoma, and 701 CNS tumor cases. Median follow-up in the cohort was 6.0 years (interquartile range: 4.3–10.1) and median cumulative exposure since birth was 8.2~mSv (range: 0–31.2). Hazard ratios per 1~mSv increase in cumulative dose of external background radiation were 1.04 (95\% CI: 1.01–1.06) for all cancers combined, 1.06 (1.01–1.10) for leukemia, 1.03 (0.98–1.08) for lymphoma, and 1.06 (1.01–1.11) for CNS tumors. Adjustment for potential confounders had little effect on the results. Based on these results, the estimated population attributable fraction for leukemia and CNS tumors due to external background radiation was 32\% (7–49\%) and 34\% (5–51\%), respectively. Conclusions Our results suggest that background ionizing radiation contributes to the risk of leukemia and CNS tumors in children.},

Geographical variation of life expectancy and its relation to the socioeconomic position of neighbourhoods are, however, not well understood. Methods We analysed the Swiss National Cohort, which linked the 2000 census with mortality records 2000–2008 to estimate life expectancy across neighbourhoods. A neighbourhood index of socioeconomic position (SEP) based on the median rent, education and occupation of household heads and crowding was calculated for 1.3 million overlapping neighbourhoods of 50 households. We used skew-normal regression models, including the index and additionally marital status, education, nationality, religion and occupation to calculate crude and adjusted estimates of life expectancy at age 30 years. Results Based on over 4.5 million individuals and over 400 000 deaths, estimates of life expectancy at age 30 in neighbourhoods ranged from 46.9 to 54.2 years in men and from 53.5 to 57.2 years in women. The correlation between life expectancy and neighbourhood SEP was strong (r=0.95 in men and r=0.94 women, both p values {$<$}0.0001). In a comparison of the lowest with the highest percentile of neighbourhood SEP, the crude difference in life expectancy from skew-normal regression was 4.5 years in men and 2.5 years in women. The corresponding adjusted differences were 2.8 and 1.9 years, respectively (all p values {$<$}0.0001). Conclusions Although life expectancy is high in Switzerland, there is substantial geographical variation and life expectancy is strongly associated with the social standing of neighbourhoods.},

  abstract = {Background Switzerland has a liberal implementation of Coronavirus mitigation measures compared to other European countries. Since March 2020, measures have been evolving and include a mixture of central and federalistic mitigation strategies across three culturally diverse language regions. The present study investigates a hypothesised heterogeneity in health, social behavior and adherence to mitigation measures across the language regions by studying pre-specified interaction effects. Our findings aim to support the communication of regionally targeted mitigation strategies and to provide evidence to address longterm population-health consequences of the pandemic by accounting for different pandemic contexts and cultural aspects. Methods We use data from from the COVID-19 Social Monitor, a longitudinal population-based online survey. We define five mitigation periods between March 2020 and May 2021. We use unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models to investigate a hypothesized interaction effect between mitigation periods and language regions on selected study outcomes covering the domains of general health and quality of life, mental health, loneliness/isolation, physical activity, health care use and adherence to mitigation measures. Results We analyze 2,163 (64\%) participants from the German/Romansh-speaking part of Switzerland, 713 (21\%) from the French-speaking part and 505 (15\%) from the Italian-speaking part. We found evidence for an interaction effect between mitigation periods and language regions for adherence to mitigation measures, but not for other study outcomes (social behavior, health). The presence of poor quality of life, lack of energy, no physical activity, health care use, and the adherence to mitigation measures changed similarly over mitigation periods in all language regions. Discussion As the pandemic unfolded in Switzerland, also health and social behavior changed between March 2020 to May 2021. Changes in adherence to mitigation measures differ between language regions and reflect the COVID-19 incidence patterns in the investigated mitigation periods, with higher adherence in regions with previously higher incidence. Targeted communcation of mitigation measures and policy making should include cultural, geographical and socioeconomic aspects to address yet unknown long-term population health consequences caused by the pandemic.},

LuftiBus in the school (LUIS) was set up to assess the respiratory health of schoolchildren in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland. LUIS is a cross-sectional population-based study that was carried out 2013 to 2016. Children aged 6-17 years living in the canton of Zurich were eligible to participate. All schools in the canton were approached and the school head decided whether the school would participate and with which classes. Consenting parents answered a standardized questionnaire at home and assenting children completed a shorter questionnaire by interview at school. Trained technicians measured children9s lung function including spirometry, double tracer gas single-breath washout (DTG-SBW) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). Address histories of participants were geocoded to be linked with area-based socioeconomic measures and environmental exposures like spatiotemporal air pollution estimates for specific time periods and locations. A subgroup was seen again 12 months later using the same procedures to collect longitudinal data. The study included 3870 children at baseline and 655 at the one-year follow-up. Median age was 12.7 years; 281 (8\%) had wheezed in the past year. At baseline we collected 3457 (89\%) parental and 3546 (92\%) children9s questionnaires, and 3393 (88\%) FeNO, 3446 (89\%) spirometry, and 1795 (46\%) DTG-SBW measurements.

In 13-17-year-olds, we studied risk factors for smoking and compared the frequency of respiratory problems between those who smoked and those who did not. Methods: We used data from LuftiBus in the school, a school-based survey of the respiratory health of children carried out 2013-2016 in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland. Participants were asked about cigarette, shisha, and electronic smoking device (ESD) smoking, and respiratory symptoms and diseases. We studied the association between smoking and risk factors using logistic regression. Results: We included 3488 schoolchildren with data on active smoking. Five percent of the 6-12-year-olds (90 of 1905) had smoked occasionally (\&lt;once/week). Among 13-17-year-olds (N=1583), 563 (36\%) had smoked occasionally of whom 414 smoked ESDs, 409 shishas, and 276 cigarettes. Among 54 (3\%) 13-17-year-olds who smoked frequently (≥once/week), 41 (76\%) smoked cigarettes, and 22\% of 15-17-year-olds (104/477) had smoked all three products. Smoking was more common in adolescents who were male, lived in rural areas, and whose mother (adjusted OR 1.7, 95\% CI 1.3-2.3) or father (aOR 1.5, 95\% CI 1.2-1.9) smoked. Respiratory symptoms in the past year such as rhinitis, dyspnoea, and wheeze were more common in adolescents who smoked frequently or occasionally than in never smokers. Conclusion: Smoking of shishas and ESDs is popular among Swiss adolescents and often combined with smoking cigarettes. Structural smoking prevention strategies should include all forms of smoking including shishas and ESDs.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Adult height reflects an individual’s socio-economic background and offers insights into the well-being of populations. Height is linked to various health outcomes such as morbidity and mortality and has consequences on the societal level. The aim of this study was to describe small-area variation of height and associated factors among young men in Switzerland. Data from 175,916 conscripts (aged between 18.50 and 20.50 years) was collected between 2005 and 2011, which represented approximately 90\% of the corresponding birth cohorts. These were analysed using Gaussian hierarchical models in a Bayesian framework to investigate the spatial pattern of mean height across postcodes. The models varied both in random effects and degree of adjustment (professional status, area-based socioeconomic position, and language region). We found a strong spatial structure for mean height across postcodes. The range of height differences between mean postcode level estimates was 3.40cm according to the best fitting model, with the shorter conscripts coming from the Italian and French speaking parts of Switzerland. There were positive socioeconomic gradients in height at both individual and area-based levels. Spatial patterns for height persisted after adjustment for individual factors, but not when language region was included. Socio-economic position and cultural/natural boundaries such as language borders and mountain passes are shaping patterns of height for Swiss conscripts. Small area mapping of height contributes to the understanding of its cofactors.},

  abstract = {Living in high-rise buildings could influence the health of residents. Previous studies focused on structural features of high-rise buildings or characteristics of their neighbourhoods, ignoring differences within buildings in socio-economic position or health outcomes. We examined mortality by floor of residence in the Swiss National Cohort, a longitudinal study based on the linkage of December 2000 census with mortality and emigration records 2001–2008. Analyses were based on 1.5 million people living in buildings with four or more floors and 142,390 deaths recorded during 11.4 million person-years of follow-up. Cox models were adjusted for age, sex, civil status, nationality, language, religion, education, professional status, type of household and crowding. The rent per m2 increased with higher floors and the number of persons per room decreased. Mortality rates decreased with increasing floors: hazard ratios comparing the ground floor with the eighth floor and above were 1.22 [95~\% confidence interval (CI) 1.15–1.28] for all causes, 1.40 (95~\% CI 1.11–1.77) for respiratory diseases, 1.35 (95~\% CI 1.22–1.49) for cardiovascular diseases and 1.22 (95~\% CI 0.99–1.50) for lung cancer, but 0.41 (95~\% CI 0.17–0.98) for suicide by jumping from a high place. There was no association with suicide by any means (hazard ratio 0.81; 95~\% CI 0.57–1.15). We conclude that in Switzerland all-cause and cause-specific mortality varies across floors of residence among people living in high-rise buildings. Gradients in mortality suggest that floor of residence captures residual socioeconomic stratification and is likely to be mediated by behavioural (e.g. physical activity), and environmental exposures, and access to a method of suicide.},

Little is known about variation of cost of end of life care between regions and the drivers of such variation. We studied small-area patterns of cost of care in the last year of life in Switzerland.         Methods:~         We used mandatory health insurance claims data of individuals who died between 2008 and 2010 to derive cost of care. We used multilevel regression models to estimate differences in costs across 564 regions of place of residence, nested within 71 hospital service areas. We examined to what extent variation was explained by characteristics of individuals and regions, including measures of health care supply.         Results:~         The study population consisted of 113,277 individuals. The mean cost of care during last year of life was 32.5k (thousand) Swiss Francs per person (SD=33.2k). Cost differed substantially between regions after adjustment for patient age, sex, and cause of death. Variance was reduced by 52\%–95\% when we added individual and regional characteristics, with a strong effect of language region. Measures of supply of care did not show associations with costs. Remaining between and within hospital service area variations were most pronounced for older females and least for younger individuals.         Conclusions:~         In Switzerland, small-area analysis revealed variation of cost of care during the last year of life according to linguistic regions and unexplained regional differences for older women. Cultural factors contribute to the delivery and utilization of health care during the last months of life and should be considered by policy makers.},

Methods The study identified homicide–suicide events 1991–2008 in persons from the same household in the Swiss National Cohort, which links census and mortality records. The analysis examined the association of the risk of dying in a homicide–suicide event with socio-demographic variables, measured at the individual-level, household composition variables and area-level variables. Proportional hazards regression models were calculated for male perpetrators and female victims. Results are presented as age-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CI). Results The study identified 158 deaths from homicide–suicide events, including 85 murder victims (62 women, 4 men, 19 children and adolescents) and 68 male and 5 female perpetrators. The incidence was 3 events per million households and year. Firearms were the most prominent method for both homicides and suicides. The risk of perpetrating homicide-suicide was higher in divorced than in married men (HR 3.64; 95\%CI 1.56–8.49), in foreigners without permanent residency compared to Swiss citizens (HR 3.95; 1.52–10.2), higher in men without religious affiliations than in Catholics (HR 2.23; 1.14–4.36) and higher in crowded households (HR 4.85; 1.72–13.6 comparing ≥2 with {$<$}1 persons/room). There was no association with education, occupation or nationality, the number of children, the language region or degree of urbanicity. Associations were similar for female victims.

The purpose of this study is to elucidate their prevalence and trends in Switzerland by analyzing variations in Body Mass Index (BMI) of Swiss conscripts. Methods The conscription records were provided by the Swiss Army. This study focussed on conscripts 18.5–20.5 years of age from the seven one-year birth cohorts spanning the period 1986–1992. BMI across professional status, area-based socioeconomic position (abSEP), urbanicity and regions was analyzed. Two piecewise quantile regression models with linear splines for three birth-cohort groups were used to examine the association of median BMI with explanatory variables and to determine the extent to which BMI has varied over time. Results The study population consisted of 188,537 individuals. Median BMI was 22.51 kg/m2 (22.45–22.57 95\% confidence interval (CI)). BMI was lower among conscripts of high professional status (−0.46 kg/m2; 95\% CI: −0.50, −0.42, compared with low), living in areas of high abSEP (−0.11 kg/m2; 95\% CI: −0.16, −0.07 compared to medium) and from urban communities (−0.07 kg/m2; 95\% CI: −0.11, −0.03, compared with peri-urban). Comparing with Midland, median BMI was highest in the North-West (0.25 kg/m2; 95\% CI: 0.19–0.30) and Central regions (0.11 kg/m2; 95\% CI: 0.05–0.16) and lowest in the East (−0.19 kg/m2; 95\% CI: −0.24, −0.14) and Lake Geneva regions (−0.15 kg/m2; 95\% CI: −0.20, −0.09). Trajectories of regional BMI growth varied across birth cohorts, with median BMI remaining high in the Central and North-West regions, whereas stabilization and in some cases a decline were observed elsewhere. Conclusions BMI of Swiss conscripts is associated with individual and abSEP and urbanicity. Results show regional variation in the levels and temporal trajectories of BMI growth and signal their possible slowdown among recent birth cohorts.},

Design Longitudinal follow-up study over the decade 2007–2016. Methods Analyses were performed on changes in number, age and sex of GPs by practice type (adult, paediatric and mixed), as well as on their geographical distribution and migration between areas characterised by deprivation index (DI) at municipality level. The association between deprivation and vacancy for GPs was studied by risk analysis. The number of population underserved was defined by DI quintile. Setting and subjects The study involved all general practices and GPs in the period examined. Main outcome measure It is showed that the number of general practices with unfilled GP posts was increasing exponentially, mainly in the most deprived areas of the country. Results A decrease in the number of GPs in all types of practices, especially in mixed (by 7.7\%; p{$<$}0.001) and paediatric (by 6.5\%; p{$<$}0.001) ones, was shown; the number of adult practices with unfilled GP posts doubled, while the number of paediatric practices with a vacancy for a paediatrician more than tripled. The average age of GPs was increased by 3.7 years (p{$<$}0.001) in adult, by 5.4 years (p{$<$}0.001) in paediatric and by 4.2 years (p{$<$}0.001) in mixed practices. In 2007, 52.27\% (95\% CI 51.03 to 53.5) of the GPs were women, and this rate increased to 56.19\% (95\% CI 54.93 to 57.44) by the end of the decade. An exponential association between relative vacancy rate and deprivation was confirmed. As a result of the migration of GPs, in the most deprived areas, the number of GPs decreased by 8.43\% (95\% CI 5.86 to 10.99). Conclusions The workforce crisis in Hungarian primary care is progressively deepening and resulting in more severe inequity in access to healthcare.},

  abstract = {Despite increasing recognition in economically developed countries of the importance of addressing health inequalities, there has been a nearly universal failure to consider equality issues in both academic reviews of approaches to suicide prevention and the formulation of national suicide prevention strategies. This has occurred despite ample evidence of systematic inequalities in the risk of suicidal behaviour associated with different indicators of social position, including labour market status, occupational social class, education, income, housing tenure and labour market position, at the individual level, and socioeconomic deprivation, at the aggregate level. This chapter reviews the relevant worldwide literature and describes an investigation of deaths due to intentional self-harm and undetermined causes in Scotland over the period 1989-2002. The weight of evidence summarised in the review points to the existence of socioeconomic inequalities in suicidal behaviour across a range of indicators at both individual and area levels. The findings of the empirical study confirm that low social class and socioeconomic deprivation are associated with increased suicide risk; and suggest that the influence of individual social class is far stronger than the influence of area-level socioeconomic affluence/deprivation in accounting for suicide-related inequality. An exceptionally high relative risk of suicide was found among those in the lowest social class living in the most deprived areas (approximately 10 times higher than the risk of suicide among those in the highest social class in the most affluent areas). The cumulative research evidence highlights the importance of applying an equity lens to national suicide prevention strategies and action plans. Many policy challenges require resolution, however, including the strategic approach to inequality reduction, whether people or places are to be targeted, and the identification of interventions that are likely to be effective in reducing socioeconomic inequalities in suicide risk.},

  abstract = {Objective Understanding the factors that influence human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination uptake is critically important to the design of effective vaccination programmes. In Switzerland, HPV vaccination uptake (≥1 dose) by age 16 years among women ranges from 31\% to 80\% across 26 cantons (states). Our objective was to identify factors that are associated with the spatial variation in HPV vaccination uptake. Methods We used cross-sectional data from the Swiss National Vaccination Coverage Survey 2009–2016 on HPV vaccination status (≥1 dose) of 14–17-year-old girls, their municipality of residence and their nationality for 21 of 26 cantons (n=8965). We examined covariates at municipality level: language, degree of urbanisation, socioeconomic position, religious denomination, results of a vote about vaccination laws as a proxy for vaccine scepticism and, at cantonal level, availability of school-based vaccination and survey period. We used a series of conditional autoregressive models to assess the effects of covariates while accounting for variability between cantons and municipal-level spatial autocorrelation. Results In the best-fit model, living in cantons that have school-based vaccination (adjusted OR 2.51; 95\% credible interval 1.77 to 3.56) was associated with increased uptake, while living in municipalities with lower acceptance of vaccination laws was associated with lower HPV vaccination uptake (OR 0.61; 95\% credible interval 0.50 to 0.73). Overall, the covariates explained 88\% of the municipal-level variation in uptake. Conclusions In Switzerland, both cantons and community opinion about vaccination play a prominent role in the variation in HPV vaccination uptake. To increase uptake, efforts should be made to mitigate vaccination scepticism and to encourage school-based vaccination.},

  abstract = {Background The inverse care law states that disadvantaged populations need more health care than advantaged populations but receive less. Gaps in COVID-19-related health care and infection control are not well understood. We aimed to examine inequalities in health in the care cascade from testing for SARS-CoV-2 to COVID-19-related hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death in Switzerland, a wealthy country strongly affected by the pandemic. Methods We analysed surveillance data reported to the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health from March 1, 2020, to April 16, 2021, and 2018 population data. We geocoded residential addresses of notifications to identify the Swiss neighbourhood index of socioeconomic position (Swiss-SEP). The index describes 1·27 million small neighbourhoods of approximately 50 households each on the basis of rent per m2, education and occupation of household heads, and crowding. We used negative binomial regression models to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95\% credible intervals (CrIs) of the association between ten groups of the Swiss-SEP index defined by deciles (1=lowest, 10=highest) and outcomes. Models were adjusted for sex, age, canton, and wave of the epidemic (before or after June 8, 2020). We used three different denominators: the general population, the number of tests, and the number of positive tests. Findings Analyses were based on 4\,129\,636 tests, 609\,782 positive tests, 26\,143 hospitalisations, 2432 ICU admissions, 9383 deaths, and 8\,221\,406 residents. Comparing the highest with the lowest Swiss-SEP group and using the general population as the denominator, more tests were done among people living in neighbourhoods of highest SEP compared with lowest SEP (adjusted IRR 1·18 [95\% CrI 1·02–1·36]). Among tested people, test positivity was lower (0·75 [0·69–0·81]) in neighbourhoods of highest SEP than of lowest SEP. Among people testing positive, the adjusted IRR was 0·68 (0·62–0·74) for hospitalisation, was 0·54 (0·43–0·70) for ICU admission, and 0·86 (0·76–0·99) for death. The associations between neighbourhood SEP and outcomes were stronger in younger age groups and we found heterogeneity between areas. Interpretation The inverse care law and socioeconomic inequalities were evident in Switzerland during the COVID-19 epidemic. People living in neighbourhoods of low SEP were less likely to be tested but more likely to test positive, be admitted to hospital, or die, compared with those in areas of high SEP. It is essential to continue to monitor testing for SARS-CoV-2, access and uptake of COVID-19 vaccination and outcomes of COVID-19. Governments and health-care systems should address this pandemic of inequality by taking measures to reduce health inequalities in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

  abstract = {Ambient air pollution is the leading cause of environmental mortality and morbidity worldwide. However, the individual contributions to acute mortality of traffic-related air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are still debated. We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study for a population located around Zurich airport in Switzerland, including 24,886 adult cardiovascular deaths from the Swiss National Cohort. We estimated the risk of cause-specific cardiovascular mortality associated with daily NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations at home using distributed lag models up to 7 days preceding death, adjusted for daily temperature, precipitation, acute night-time aircraft noise, firework celebrations, and holidays. Cardiovascular mortality was associated with NO2, whereas the association with PM2.5 disappeared upon adjustment for NO2. The strongest association was observed between NO2 and ischemic stroke mortality (odds ratio~=~1.55 per 10~μg/m3, 95\% confidence intervals~=~1.20–2.00). Cause-specific mortality analyses showed differences in terms of delayed effect: odds ratios were highest at 1–3 days after exposure for most outcomes but at lags of 3–5 days for heart failure. Individual vulnerabilities to NO2 associated cardiovascular mortality also varied by cause of death, possibly highlighting the role of different behaviours and risk factors in the most susceptible groups. The risk of cardiovascular mortality was also increased on firework days and after public holidays, independent from NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations. This study confirms the association between ambient NO2, as a marker for primary emissions, and acute cardiovascular mortality in a specific setting around a major airport. Future research should clarify the role of additional air pollutants including ultra-fine particles on cardiovascular diseases to inform most efficient control measures.},

We derived hospital service areas (HSAs) by analyzing patient flows, assigning regions from which most residents were discharged to the same VP/BKP specific HSA. We calculated age-/sex-standardized mean VP/BKP-rates and measures of regional variation (extremal quotient [EQ], systematic component of variation [SCV]). We estimated the reduction in variation of VP/BKP rates using negative binomial regression, with adjustment for patient demographic and regional socioeconomic factors (socioeconomic status, urbanization, and language region). We considered the residual, unexplained variation most likely to be unwarranted. Results Overall, 4955 VP/BKPs were performed in Switzerland in 2012/13. The age-/sex-standardized mean VP/BKP rate was 4.6/10,000 persons and ranged from 1.0 to 10.1 across 26 HSAs. The EQ was 10.2 and the SCV 57.6, indicating a large variation across VP/BKP specific HSAs. After adjustment for demographic and socioeconomic factors, the total reduction in variance was 32.2\% only, with the larger part of the variation remaining unexplained. Conclusions We found a 10-fold variation in VP/BKP rates across Swiss VP/BKP specific HSAs. As only one third of the variation was explained by differences in patient demographics and regional socioeconomic factors, VP/BKP in the highest-use areas may, at least partially, represent overtreatment.},

  abstract = {Background Gestational age and birth weight are strong predictors of infant morbidity and mortality. Understanding spatial variation can inform policies to reduce health inequalities. We examined small-area variation in gestational age and birth weight in Switzerland. Methods All singleton live births recorded in the Swiss Live Birth Register 2011 to 2014 were eligible. We deterministically linked the Live Birth Register with census and survey data to create data sets including neonatal and pregnancy-related variables, parental characteristics and geographical variables. We produced maps of 705 areas and fitted linear mixed-effect models to assess to what extent spatial variation was explained by these variables. Results We analysed all 315 177 eligible live births. Area-level averages of gestational age varied between 272 and 279 days, and between 3138 and 3467 g for birth weight. The fully adjusted models explained 31\% and 87\% of spatial variation of gestational age and birth weight, respectively. Language region accounted for most of the explained variation (23\% in gestational age and 62\% in birth weight), with shorter gestational age (−0.6 days and −0.9 days) and lower birth weight (−1.1\% and −1.8\%) in French-speaking and Italian-speaking areas, respectively, compared with German-speaking areas. Other variables explaining variation were, for gestational age, the level of urbanisation (10\%) and parental nationality (3\%). For birth weight, they were gestational age (27\%), parental nationality (27\%), civil status (10\%) and altitude (10\%). In a random sample of 81 968 live births with data on parental education, levels of education were only weakly associated with gestational age (−0.9 days for compulsory vs tertiary maternal education) or birth weight (−0.7\% for compulsory vs tertiary maternal education). Conclusions In Switzerland, small area variation in birth weight is largely explained, and variation in gestational age partially explained, by geocultural, sociodemographic and pregnancy factors.},

Design, setting and participants Longitudinal study of the adult Swiss population (n = 4 376 873) based on census records linked to mortality data from 2001 to 2008. Measurements Sex-specific hazard ratios (HR) for death and 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CI) were calculated using Cox models adjusting for age, educational level, occupational attainment, marital status and other potential confounders. The density of alcohol-selling outlets within 1000 m of the residence was calculated using geocodes of outlets and residences. Findings Compared with {$>$}17 outlets within 1000 m the HR for alcohol-related mortality in men was 0.95 (95\%CI: 0.89–1.02) for 8–17 outlets, 0.84 (95\%CI: 0.77–0.90) for 3–7 outlets, 0.76 (95\%CI: 0.68–0.83) for 1–2 outlets and 0.60 (95\%CI: 0.51–0.72) for 0 outlets. The gradient in women was somewhat steeper, with a HR comparing 0 with {$>$}17 outlets of 0.39 (95\%CI: 0.26–0.60). Mortality from mental and behavioural causes and lung cancer were also associated with density of alcohol-selling outlets: HRs comparing 0 outlets with {$>$}17 outlets were 0.64 (95\%CI: 0.52–0.79) and 0.79 (95\%CI: 0.72–0.88), respectively, in men and 0.46 (95\%CI: 0.27–0.78) and 0.63 (95\%CI: 0.52–0.77), respectively, in women. There were weak associations in the same direction with all-cause mortality in men but not in women. Conclusions In Switzerland, alcohol-related mortality is associated with the density of outlets around the place of residence. Community-level interventions to reduce alcohol outlet density may usefully complement existing interventions.},

The extent to which low-dose radiation from natural sources contributes to the risk of childhood cancer remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: In a nationwide census-based cohort study, we investigated whether the incidence of childhood cancer was associated with background radiation from terrestrial gamma and cosmic rays. METHODS: Children {$<$} 16 years of age in the Swiss National Censuses in 1990 and 2000 were included. The follow-up period lasted until 2008, and incident cancer cases were identified from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. A radiation model was used to predict dose rates from terrestrial and cosmic radiation at locations of residence. Cox regression models were used to assess associations between cancer risk and dose rates and cumulative dose since birth. RESULTS: Among 2,093,660 children included at census, 1,782 incident cases of cancer were identified including 530 with leukemia, 328 with lymphoma, and 423 with a tumor of the central nervous system (CNS). Hazard ratios for each millisievert increase in cumulative dose of external radiation were 1.03 (95\% CI: 1.01, 1.05) for any cancer, 1.04 (95\% CI: 1.00, 1.08) for leukemia, 1.01 (95\% CI: 0.96, 1.05) for lymphoma, and 1.04 (95\% CI: 1.00, 1.08) for CNS tumors. Adjustment for a range of potential confounders had little effect on the results. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that background radiation may contribute to the risk of cancer in children, including leukemia and CNS tumors.}

Few studies have focused specifically on benzene. Objectives To examine whether parental occupational exposure to benzene is associated with an increased cancer risk in a census-based cohort of children. Methods From a census-based cohort study in Switzerland, we included children aged {$<$}16years at national censuses (1990, 2000). We retrieved parental occupations reported at census and assessed exposure to benzene using a job exposure matrix. We identified incident cancer cases through record linkage with the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. We fitted Cox proportional-hazards models to assess associations between exposures and the following outcomes: any cancer, leukaemia, acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, central nervous system (CNS) tumours, and glioma. We adjusted models for a range of socio-economic, perinatal and environmental factors. Results Analyses of maternal (paternal) exposure were based on 9.0 (13.2)millionperson years at risk and included 1004 (1520) cases of cancer, of which 285 (438) had leukaemia, 186 (281) lymphoma, 227 (339) a CNS tumour. Maternal exposure was associated with an increased risk of childhood leukaemia (hazard ratio 1.73, 95\% CI 1.12–2.67) and ALL (1.88, 1.16–3.04). We found little evidence of an association for other outcomes or for paternal exposure. Adjusting for potential confounders did not materially affect the results. Conclusions This nationwide cohort study suggests an increased risk of leukaemia among children whose mothers were exposed to benzene at work.},

In time to event analysis based on 532 cases the adjusted hazard ratio for leukaemia comparing children living {$<$}100 m from a highway with unexposed children ({$>$}/=500 m) was 1.43 (95 \% CI 0.79, 2.61). Results were similar in incidence density analysis including 1367 leukaemia cases (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.57; 95 \% CI 1.09, 2.25).

Methods In a population-based longitudinal study, we investigated assisted suicides in Switzerland over the period 2003–2014. Two groups of younger (25–64 years) and older (65–94 years) persons were analysed separately and compared. We calculated crude rates and used Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression models to examine associations of assisted dying with gender, marital status, education, religion, neighbourhood socioeconomic status and other variables, and investigated trends over time. Results We identified 3941 assisted suicides among 6 237 997 Swiss residents, 80\% of which occurred in the older age group. Crude rates of assisted suicide more than tripled during the study period from 3.60 to 11.21 per 100 000 person-years; the increase was more pronounced in the older age group. Cancer was the most common underlying diagnosis (41.8\%), but the percentage dying assisted was highest among patients with diseases of the nervous system (5.25\% in the younger and 1.23\% in the older age group). The factors associated with assisted suicide did not change during the study period. Female gender, higher education, having no religious affiliation, no children and a Swiss passport, living in a neighbourhood with a higher socioeconomic index and living in the French-speaking part of Switzerland were associated with a higher rate. Conclusions The study results do not indicate any shift in socioeconomic factors associated with assisted suicide, but a more pronounced increase in incidence among the elderly.},

We examined sociodemographic factors associated with suicide in Swiss adolescents and analysed time trends in youth suicide in the Swiss National Cohort (SNC). The SNC is a longitudinal study of the whole Swiss resident population, based on linkage of census and mortality records. We identified suicides in adolescents aged 10–18~years from 1991 to 2013. A total of 2.396 million adolescents were included and 592 suicides were recorded, corresponding to a rate of 3.7 per 100,000 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 3.4–4.0]. Rates increased with age from 0.0 per 100,000 at age 10~years to 14.8 per 100,000 (95\% CI 12.6–17.5) at 18~years in boys, and from 0.0 to 5.4 per 100,000 (4.1–7.2) in girls. Being a boy, living in a single parent household, being an only or middle-born child, and living in rural regions were factors associated with a higher rate of suicide. Hanging was the most common method in boys, and railway suicides were most frequent in girls. There was no clear evidence for an increase or decrease over calendar time. We conclude that familial and socioeconomic factors including type of household, birth order and urbanity are associated with youth suicide in Switzerland. These factors should be considered when designing prevention programmes for youth suicide.},

In 1093 (84.0\%) assisted suicides, an underlying cause was recorded; cancer was the most common cause (508, 46.5\%). In both age groups, assisted suicide was more likely in women than in men, those living alone compared with those living with others and in those with no religious affiliation compared with Protestants or Catholics. The rate was also higher in more educated people, in urban compared with rural areas and in neighbourhoods of higher socio-economic position. In older people, assisted suicide was more likely in the divorced compared with the married; in younger people, having children was associated with a lower rate.Conclusions: Assisted suicide in Switzerland was associated with female gender and situations that may indicate greater vulnerability such as living alone or being divorced, but also with higher education and higher socio-economic position.}

  abstract = {Background Hysterectomy is the last treatment option for benign uterine diseases, and vaginal hysterectomy is preferred over more invasive techniques. We assessed the regional variation in hysterectomy rates for benign uterine diseases across Switzerland and explored potential determinants of variation. Methods We conducted a population-based analysis using patient discharge data from all Swiss hospitals between 2013 and 2016. Hospital service areas (HSAs) for hysterectomies were derived by analyzing patient flows. We calculated age-standardized mean procedure rates and measures of regional variation (extremal quotient [EQ], highest divided by lowest rate) and systematic component of variation [SCV]). We estimated the reduction in the variance of crude hysterectomy rates across HSAs in multilevel regression models, with incremental adjustment for procedure year, age, cultural/socioeconomic factors, burden of disease, and density of gynecologists. Results Overall, 40,211 hysterectomies from 54 HSAs were analyzed. The mean age-standardized hysterectomy rate was 298/100,000 women (range 186–456). While the variation in overall procedure rate was moderate (EQ 2.5, SCV 3.7), we found a very high procedure-specific variation (EQ vaginal 5.0, laparoscopic 6.3, abdominal 8.0; SCV vaginal 17.5, laparoscopic 11.2, abdominal 16.9). Adjusted for procedure year, demographic, cultural, and sociodemographic factors, a large share (64\%) of the variance remained unexplained (vaginal 63\%, laparoscopic 85\%, abdominal 70\%). The main determinants of variation were socioeconomic/cultural factors. Burden of disease and the density of gynecologists was not associated with procedure rates. Conclusions Switzerland has a very high regional variation in vaginal, laparoscopic, and abdominal hysterectomy for benign uterine disease. After adjustment for potential determinants of variation including demographic factors, socioeconomic and cultural factors, burden of disease, and the density of gynecologists, two thirds of the variation remain unexplained.},

Objectives: The aims of this study were to investigate the association between short-term air pollution exposure and lung function and to assess whether short-term deviations of air pollutant concentration should be integrated into long-term exposure models. Methods: Short-term (daily averages 0–7 d prior) and long-term (1- and 4-y means) NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations were modeled using satellite, land use, and meteorological data calibrated on ground measurements. Forced expiratory volume within the first second (FEV1) of forced exhalation and forced vital capacity (FVC) were measured during a LuftiBus assessment (2003–2012) and linked to exposure information from the Swiss National Cohort for 36,085 adults (ages 18–95 y). We used multiple linear regression to estimate adjusted associations, and additionally adjusted models of long-term exposures for short-term deviations in air pollutant concentrations. Results: A 10μg/m3 increase in NO2 and PM2.5 on the day of the pulmonary function test was associated with lower FEV1 and FVC (NO2: FEV1 −8.0\,ml [95\% confidence interval: −13.4, −2.7], FVC −16.7\,ml [−23.4, −10.0]; PM2.5: FEV1 −15.3\,ml [−21.9, −8.7], FVC −18.5\,ml [−26.5, −10.5]). A 10μg/m3 increase in 1-y mean NO2 was also associated with lower FEV1 (−7.7\,ml; −15.9, 0.5) and FVC (−21.6\,ml; −31.9, −11.4), as was a 10μg/m3 increase in 1-y mean PM2.5 (FEV1: −42.2\,ml; −56.9, −27.5; FVC: −82.0\,ml; −100.1, −63.9). These associations were robust to adjustment for short-term deviations in the concentration of each air pollutant. Conclusions: Short- and long-term air pollution exposures were negatively associated with lung function, in particular long-term PM2.5 exposure with FVC. Our findings contribute substantially to the evidence of adverse associations between air pollution and lung function in adults. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7529},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Potentially avoidable risk factors continue to cause unnecessary disability and premature death in older people. Health risk assessment (HRA), a method successfully used in working-age populations, is a promising method for cost-effective health promotion and preventive care in older individuals, but the long-term effects of this approach are unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of an innovative approach to HRA and counselling in older individuals for health behaviours, preventive care, and long-term survival.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: This study was a pragmatic, single-centre randomised controlled clinical trial in community-dwelling individuals aged 65 y or older registered with one of 19 primary care physician (PCP) practices in a mixed rural and urban area in Switzerland. From November 2000 to January 2002, 874 participants were randomly allocated to the intervention and 1,410 to usual care. The intervention consisted of HRA based on self-administered questionnaires and individualised computer-generated feedback reports, combined with nurse and PCP counselling over a 2-y period. Primary outcomes were health behaviours and preventive care use at 2 y and all-cause mortality at 8 y. At baseline, participants in the intervention group had a mean ± standard deviation of 6.9 ± 3.7 risk factors (including unfavourable health behaviours, health and functional impairments, and social risk factors) and 4.3 ± 1.8 deficits in recommended preventive care. At 2 y, favourable health behaviours and use of preventive care were more frequent in the intervention than in the control group (based on z-statistics from generalised estimating equation models). For example, 70\% compared to 62\% were physically active (odds ratio 1.43, 95\% CI 1.16-1.77, p = 0.001), and 66\% compared to 59\% had influenza vaccinations in the past year (odds ratio 1.35, 95\% CI 1.09-1.66, p = 0.005). At 8 y, based on an intention-to-treat analysis, the estimated proportion alive was 77.9\% in the intervention and 72.8\% in the control group, for an absolute mortality difference of 4.9\% (95\% CI 1.3\%-8.5\%, p = 0.009; based on z-test for risk difference). The hazard ratio of death comparing intervention with control was 0.79 (95\% CI 0.66-0.94, p = 0.009; based on Wald test from Cox regression model), and the number needed to receive the intervention to prevent one death was 21 (95\% CI 12-79). The main limitations of the study include the single-site study design, the use of a brief self-administered questionnaire for 2-y outcome data collection, the unavailability of other long-term outcome data (e.g., functional status, nursing home admissions), and the availability of long-term follow-up data on mortality for analysis only in 2014.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first trial to our knowledge demonstrating that a collaborative care model of HRA in community-dwelling older people not only results in better health behaviours and increased use of recommended preventive care interventions, but also improves survival. The intervention tested in our study may serve as a model of how to implement a relatively low-cost but effective programme of disease prevention and health promotion in older individuals.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nTRIAL REGISTRATION: International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number: ISRCTN 28458424.},

  abstract = {Green space may improve health by enabling physical activity and recovery from stress or by decreased pollution levels. We investigated the association between residential green (greenness or green space) and mortality in adults using the Swiss National Cohort (SNC) by mutually considering air pollution and transportation noise exposure. To reflect residential green at the address level, two different metrics were derived: normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) for greenness, and high resolution land use classification data to identify green spaces (LU-green). We used stratified Cox proportional hazard models (stratified by sex) to study the association between exposure and all natural cause mortality, respiratory and cardiovascular disease (CVD), including ischemic heart disease, stroke and hypertension related mortality. Models were adjusted for civil status, job position, education, neighbourhood socio-economic position (SEP), geographic region, area type, altitude, air pollution (PM10), and transportation noise. From the nation-wide SNC, 4.2 million adults were included providing 7.8years of follow-up and respectively 363,553, 85,314 and 232,322 natural cause, respiratory and CVD deaths. Hazard ratios (and 95\%-confidence intervals) for NDVI [and LU-green] per interquartile range within 500m of residence were highly comparable: 0.94 (0.93–0.95) [0.94 (0.93–0.95)] for natural causes; 0.92 (0.91–0.94) [0.92 (0.90–0.95)] for respiratory; and 0.95 (0.94–0.96) [0.96 (0.95–0.98)] for CVD mortality. Protective effects were stronger in younger individuals and in women and, for most outcomes, in urban (vs. rural) and in the highest (vs. lowest) SEP quartile. Estimates remained virtually unchanged after incremental adjustment for air pollution and transportation noise, and mediation by these environmental factors was found to be small. We found consistent evidence that residential green reduced the risk of mortality independently from other environmental exposures. This suggests the protective effect goes beyond the absence of pollution sources. Environmental public health measures should not only aim at reducing pollutant exposure, but additionally maintain existing and increase residential green in areas where lacking.},

The EXPANSE (EXposome Powered tools for healthy living in urbAN SEttings) project will study the impact of the urban exposome on the major contributors to Europe’s burden of disease: Cardio-Metabolic and Pulmonary Disease. EXPANSE will address one of the most pertinent questions for urban planners, policy makers, and European citizens: “How to maximize one’s health in a modern urban environment?” EXPANSE will take the next step in exposome research by (1) bringing together exposome and health data of more than 55 million adult Europeans and OMICS information for more than 2 million Europeans; (2) perform personalized exposome assessment for 5,000 individuals in five urban regions; (3) applying ultra-high-resolution mass-spectrometry to screen for chemicals in 10,000 blood samples; (4) evaluating the evolution of the exposome and health through the life course; and (5) evaluating the impact of changes in the urban exposome on the burden of cardiometabolic and pulmonary disease. EXPANSE will translate its insights and innovations into research and dissemination tools that will be openly accessible via the EXPANSE toolbox. By applying innovative ethics-by-design throughout the project, the social and ethical acceptability of these tools will be safeguarded. EXPANSE is part of the European Human Exposome Network.},

Objective We assessed the regional variation in HA/KA rates and potential determinants of variation in Switzerland. Methods We conducted a population-based analysis using discharge data from all Swiss hospitals during 2013–2016. We derived hospital service areas (HSAs) by analyzing patient flows. We calculated age-/sex-standardized procedure rates and measures of variation (the extremal quotient [EQ, highest divided by lowest rate] and the systemic component of variation [SCV]). We estimated the reduction in variance of HA/KA rates across HSAs in multilevel regression models, with incremental adjustment for procedure year, age, sex, language, urbanization, socioeconomic factors, burden of disease, and the number of orthopedic surgeons. Results Overall, 69,578 HA and 69,899 KA from 55 HSAs were analyzed. The mean age-/sex-standardized HA rate was 265 (range 179–342) and KA rate was 256 (range 186–378) per 100,000 persons and increased over time. The EQ was 1.9 for HA and 2.5 for KA. The SCV was 2.0 for HA and 2.2 for KA, indicating a low variation across HSAs. When adjusted for procedure year and demographic, cultural, and sociodemographic factors, the models explained 75\% of the variance in HA and 63\% in KA across Swiss HSAs. Conclusion Switzerland has high HA/KA rates with a modest regional variation, suggesting that the threshold to perform HA/KA may be uniformly low across regions. One third of the variation remained unexplained and may, at least in part, represent differing physician beliefs and attitudes towards joint arthroplasty.},
