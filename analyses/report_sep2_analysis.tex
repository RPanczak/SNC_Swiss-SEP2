\section{Building age}

Construction period of the building is retrived sfrom \texttt{STATPOP 2018} dataset. Detailed typology is recoded to binary indicator flagging 
buildings constructed on or after 2001. Buidlings with missing information about age are treated as 'old' ones.

\section{Hybrid version of SEP}

This solution is mixing versions 1.0 \& 2.0. First the new buildings have value of index 1.0 assigned using the closest (linear dstance) neighbour. 

Then, construction period of the building is retrived sfrom \texttt{STATPOP 2018} dataset and then buildings built before year 2000 have the values of 1.0 index assigned and buildings constructed after 2000 have new values assigned. Buildings without the defined period of construction keep values 1.0 also.

Note that the original quantiles of second version :

... are tad 'broken' after replacements:
